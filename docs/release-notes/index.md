# Version 7

## 7.1

*Release date: June 25, 2021*

Download from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9pnlmkkpcljj?ocid=badge" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> or click [here](https://lun-eu.icons8.com/s/setup/LunacySetup_7.1.0.exe) to get the Installer.


### New features

#### Privacy and share links management

Now you can have three types of cloud documents:

* **Public** - accessible for everyone with the link. Visible in your profile for other users. In one of the upcoming versions, users will be able to view profiles of other users.
* **Hidden** - accessible for everyone with the link. Hidden from other users in your profile.
* **Private** - accessible only with personal links that can be used only once. So, every time you want to invite a new user to a private document, you should send a new link. You can always withdraw your private link by clicking **X** next to the username. This will make the link invalid and throw the user out of the document.

![Cloud doc types](/public/rn71-privacy.png)


**Note:** *Currently, everyone with a link to your document can edit it. Soon, you will be able to set read-only privileges.*

#### Observer Mode

The Observer Mode enables you to follow the activities of other users on the canvas. For this, click the user's avatar in the top-right corner. You will see a colored frame around the canvas, indicating that you're now in the Observer Mode.


![Observer mode](/public/rn71_observermode.png)

To exit the mode, click the user's avatar once again.

**Note:** *You will only be able to view the user's activities on the canvas.Â You won't be able to see the interactions on the side panels.*

### Improvements

* Now you can set your own images for your avatar and the name that the other users will see during collaboration.
* Now you can set the default emoji font. For this, go to **View** > **Emoji Style**. Available fonts are: Segoe UI Emoji, Noto Sans Emoji, Apple Color Emoji.
* Now when a user clicks the link that you shared over a messenger or email, the link opens a page that explains how to use the link and offers to start Lunacy.
* Ability to delete all files from **Home** > **Deleted** in a single click.
* Font previews are now displayed in the default font language.
* Minor Vector Tool improvements.
* Support of HSL/HSB in the Color Picker.
* Other minor improvements.

### Fixed bugs

* Numerous bug fixes


## 7.0

*Release date: May 21, 2021*

Download from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9pnlmkkpcljj?ocid=badge" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> or click [here](https://lun-eu.icons8.com/s/setup/LunacySetup_7.0.0.exe) to get the Installer.

### New features

#### Home Tab

We replaced the **Welcome Window** with the **Home Tab**.  You can now always access it from the top panel (![Home icon](/public/rn70_homeicon.png)).
Also, we moved the **Sign in/Sign up** form and the list of **Recent documents** to the **Home Tab** (see the figure below).


![Home tab](/public/rn70-hometab.png)

#### Lunacy Cloud (Beta)

We are introducing **Lunacy Cloud** and discontinue the support of Sketch Cloud.

To create a cloud document, click **File** > **New Cloud**.

The list of your documents appears in the **Recent** and **Documents** sections of the **Home Tab**.

You can access your cloud documents from any computer under your Icons8 account.

Also, currently, cloud documents are accessible by anyone with the link. More flexible sharing options will be added in the upcoming versions.

To get a link, click **Share** in the upper-right corner. The link will get copied to your clipboard.

![Home tab](/public/rn70-cloud.png)

There are two ways to open a cloud document via a link:

-  Copy the link, then click **File > Open URL From Clipboard**.
-  Copy the link and press `Ctrl+V` over any document or the **Home Tab**.
To save a cloud document locally, go to **File > Save as Local Copy**.

**Note:** *To go on working with a local copy, open it from where you saved it.*


Local files now appear in the top panel with the document icon (![Document icon](/public/rn70-docicon.png)) before the file name.


![Lunacy cloud](/public/rn70-cloud1.png)
#### Collaboration (Beta)

Collaboration, the most awaited feature by Lunacy fans, is finally here!

Now you can work with the same cloud documents simultaneously with other users. Just share the link to the document and enjoy the teamwork.

![Lunacy cloud](/public/rn70-collab.png)

For obvious reasons, we could not test all the scenarios and intricacies of multi-user editing without real users. So, let's call it a feature preview. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to report them (**Help > Report a Problem**).

#### Armenian Language

Big thanks to Sargis_k for helping us out with the Armenian localization.

![Lunacy cloud](/public/rn70-armen.png)


If you also want to take part in Lunacy localization, click <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/localization/" target="_blank">here</a>.


### Improvements

* Now the default font for all text blocks is Inter. Also, now it is the font of our interface. It is a free Google font that can be used on all platforms. Previously it was Segoe UI. But it is authorized only for Windows. Now guess why we did it ðŸ˜‰.
* New hotkeys for navigation through document pages (**Page up/Page down**) and artboards (**Home/End**).
* Improved UI for Objects, Styles, Color Picker, Top bar and Main menu.
* The limit for Gaussian blur is now 10000. The max value of the slider is still 50. But if you need more blur, you can enter the required value manually.
* Now you always have access to the list of document pages. You no longer have to switch to the Objects tab to navigate through pages.
* The button on the right end of the search bar now enables you to quickly collapse the object tree.
* Ability to switch between Lunacy servers for better connectivity (**Help > Region**).
* Now, if you need more space in the top bar, you can hide the Main menu by clicking the arrow next to the Lunacy logo.
* Other minor improvements

### New features

#### Prototype Preview

In the previous versions, to preview a prototype, you had to upload a document to Sketch Cloud. Now you can do it right within Lunacy even without an internet connection.

Moreover, we added the support for scrollable artboards in prototypes.

To run the prototype previewer, select an artboard you want to start with and click the Play button in the upper-right corner of the interface. A new window will open next to Lunacy.

Also, you can instantly upload your prototypes to our Cloud and share them with other people. Just click the chain link button at the top of the preview window and send the link to your teammate or customer. 
For details, click <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/prototyping/" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Avatar tool

We integrated the avatar tool with the <a href="https://generated.photos/" target="_blank">generated.photos</a> project. Now you can select between the photos of real-life models (default) and photos of people generated by AI. In the latter case, you can choose the desired gender, age, ethnicity, and hair color of a model. Then click **Generate avatar** and enjoy the magic!

**Note:** You need an internet connection to be able to use this feature.

Also, now you can refresh multiple avatars at a time. For this, select several avatars and press `Shift+R` or click **Generate avatar** in the Inspector.

### New features

#### Redesigned left panel

Lunacy 6.1 comes with a new look of the left panel. It has become easier to switch between the Objects list and the Libraries (Symbols, Styles, Icons, etc.).

To minimize the left panel, click the icon of the currently open section or use a respective shortcut (`Alt+1`, `Alt+2`, ... `Alt+8`).       

Also, we revised the order of tools on the toolbar.

The video below presents these and some other changes introduced in v.6.1.

<video play="no" controls="controls" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/rn-61videoph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/Lunacy61.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


#### Snapping: Pen

The Pen tool has become a lot easier to use. Now when you draw a path, Lunacy snaps new points to horizontal and vertical lines that can be drawn through the point you are going to add and existing points. Also new points snap to:

* existing segments and their centers
* guides
* grids and layouts

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/rn-pensnapph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/rn-pensnap.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Snapping: Color Picker
Now when you adjust a linear or radial gradient by moving a color point, Lunacy snaps the point to the borders and midlines of the shape's bounding box.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/rn-colorsnapph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/rn-colorsnap.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Also, you can hold down Shift to get a perfectly vertical, horizontal or 45-degree diagonal gradient.

### Improvements

* Now you can toggle the suggestions panel using the `Ctrl+Space` shortcut or the bulb button on the action bar.
* The ability to globally set icons color and size was removed. Now you can apply colors (tints) to icons individually through the suggestions panel.
* Now symbol instances can have different states (hovered, pressed, etc.)
* Added the Swap at Original Size option to the symbol settings in the Inspector. With this option enabled (default), when you swap a symbol, the selected instance will resize to fit the original size of the new symbol.
* The license pop-up window will no longer disturb you. Now license proposals appear in the suggestions panel.
* The Code panel tab is no longer available in the Inspector. To display the panel, use the View menu, context menu or the `F4` hotkey.
* Search fields improvements. Now all content filters appear in the search fields.
* Tips with links to our docs now show up when you hover the cursor over some section names in the Inspector (**Appearance**, **Symbols**, **Tints**, and some other).

* The issue with color boxes showing HEX values even when the fill type was other than solid.
* Currency symbols in generated texts now go in front of digits
* Typography issues
* Prototyping issues
* Suggestions issues
* Other minor fixes


## 6.0

*Release date: August 04, 2020*

Download from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9pnlmkkpcljj?ocid=badge) or the [Installer](https://lun-eu.icons8.com/s/setup/LunacySetup_6.0.0.exe)

### New features

#### Support for Sketch plugins (Beta)

Lunacy v.6 brings the support for Sketch plugins. Please note that Lunacy supports only the latest JavaScript version of the <a href="https://developer.sketch.com/reference/api/" target="_blank">Sketch API</a>. Also, with limitations it supports:

* Sketch Utilities (except for polyfill fetch)
* Some most frequent Objective C Objects

Lunacy does not and will never support:

* Objective C preprocessor
* OSX Compiled components
* Access to the Cocoa UI

As of now, there is no way to say for sure whether this or that Sketch plugin downloaded from the internet will work in Lunacy. But we've added is a  special panel where you can download plugins verified and approved by our team. We will regularly update the content of the panel.

Now you can also write and run you own scripts directly in Lunacy and save them as plugins.

If you've written a plugin of your own and want to share it with other users, you can email us a link to the project GitHub page at lunacy@icons8.com.

For details about working with plugins in Lunacy, read <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/plugins/" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Tint Overrides

In the previous version we added tints. This version comes with tint overrides. They can be handy, for instance, when you are designing tabs or panels with elements that can have different states expressed through different colors.

Note that before using tint overrides you should add default tints.

When you apply an override, the reset button appears in the **Tint** section of the Inspector. Use this button to remove the override.

![Reset overrides button](/public/reset-overridetint.png)

For details and a demo, click <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/styling/#tint-overrides" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Snap to spacing

We've added another great feature that will help you quickly arrange objects on the canvas.

Now when you have two or more vertically or horizontally distributed objects and you drag another object close to them, Lunacy snaps the object and shows a pink area when the spacing between the object you drag is the same as one of the spacings between the other objects. See the demo below.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/snapping-spacingph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/snapping-spacing1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To disable snapping, hold down `Ctrl` while dragging.

### Improvements

* The button that allows you to log into your Icons8 account now appears on the action bar in the upper-right corner of the screen.
* Support of the Sketch artboard state logic: resized state and scrollable prototypes.
* Now when you delete a master symbol that has instances, Lunacy will ask you to confirm your intent.
* A new way of switching to the text editing mode: enable the text tool (press `T` or select it on the toolbar) and click over the text that you want to edit.
* The suggestions panel now also appears when you work with stars, polygons, triangles, lines and arrows, provided that you've created them with respective tools.


### Fixed bugs

* The issue with high scrolling speed of the object list scrolled with a touchpad.
* Prototyping issues.
* Color picker issues.
* Vector tool issues.

# Version 5

Version 5 takes Lunacy out of beta (better stability and performance), provides full support for Sketch files, and adds many useful new features.


## 5.9

*Release date: July 03, 2020*

Download from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9pnlmkkpcljj?ocid=badge) or the [Installer](https://lun-eu.icons8.com/s/setup/LunacySetup_5.9.0.exe)

### New features

#### Suggestions panel

Now when you select a shape, an open path or a text you will see a panel with suggestions of styling options based on your previous actions and choices. In case you've just started using Lunacy, the panel will provide some preset styles.
You can:
* Scroll the content of each panel column (except for font size).
* Resize the panel and its columns.
* Move it up or down by dragging the handle in the top-left corner of the panel. Lunacy remembers the position of the panel individually for each object. 
* Manage the content of the panel. Right-click over the panel to invoke the context menu and see the options.
* Disable the panel through **View** > **Suggestions**.

The figure below shows views of suggestions panel for a shape and a text.

![Suggestions panels](/public/rn-suggpanels.png)

For details about using the panels, read <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/styling/#suggestions-panel" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/text/#suggestions-panel" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Tints
Tints are a quick and easy way to apply a color to grouped objects and symbol instances. They are particularly useful when you need to adjust the color of a semi-filled object or a complex icon.

The **Tints** section appears in the Inspector only when you select a group object or a symbol.

![Tints](/public/rn5_9-tints.png)

Unlike other styling options, you can apply only one tint to an object.

#### GUI tools

We've added a set of tools that allows you to quickly add basic GUI controls that include:

* Drop-down lists
* Buttons
* Text fields
* Checkboxes
* Radio buttons and
* Toggles

![Tints](/public/rn5_9-guitools1.png)

When you select a control added with any of these tools, you see the suggestions panel that allows you to:
1. Change the type of the control.
2. Select the style of the control.
3. Select the control state.

![GUI tools](/public/rn5_9-guitools3.png)

To edit the appearance of a control, use the <a href="https://docs.icons8.com/components/#editing-main-components" target="_blank">symbol editor</a>.

#### Symbol tool

The symbol tool allows you to quickly create mockups of interfaces by adding placeholder symbols and then replacing them with required GUI elements.

![Symbol tool](/public/rn5_9-symbtool.png)

![Placeholder symbols](/public/rn5_9-symbtool2.png)

* To replace a placeholder symbol, select it and use the suggestions panel that will appear.    
* You can also use use symbols from the Symbols page. For this, enable the tool, then go to the Symbols page and click the required Symbol. The same applies to symbols from UI kits.
* When the Symbol tool is enabled, you can press the `C` and `Shift+C` hotkeys to switch between the symbols that you've used earlier and quickly add them onto the canvas.
* If you want your custom symbols to appear on the suggestions panel, you should properly tag them in the Inspector. For this, click ![Tag symbol button](/public/rn5_9-symbtool5.png) in the **Symbol** section of the Inspector and select a proper category.

#### Text formatting

Text formatting has become a way easier. You no longer need to select a word or the whole text to make it bold, italicized or whatever.

Just set the caret inside a word or at the end of the text and apply the required formatting. In the latter case, the formatting will be applied to the whole text.

* Text alignment magnets now also appear upon selection of multiple text objects.
* Newly-added text objects now inherit the style of the previous text.
* Now you can edit the layout grid for several artboards at the same time.
* Now you can tag symbol types for better symbol suggestions.

# Version 2

We've [presented](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/icons8-lunacy-2-0) this version middle 2017. Lunacy version 2 didn't allow editing and served as a handoff tool. It allowed to view the documents, copy the CSS code, and export assets. 

# Version 1

After the meticulous testing with all kinds of Sketch files, we've launched Lunacy as a .sketch viewer. Two weeks after, version 43 came, completely changing the format. We had to rework it from scratch.
