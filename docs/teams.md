Create **teams** to optimize your workflow with design files and systems. With teams, you can collaborate with other users and organize your documents into **projects**, which work just like folders.

To start working with teams, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#account-and-profile" target="_blank">log in to your Icons8 account</a>. You can create and see your teams in the left panel of the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#home-tab" target="_blank">Home tab</a>.

This chapter covers the basics of working with teams, collaboration and project options, and team management.

## How teams work in Lunacy

Teams are available for all registered users. You can create one team on the trial plan and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#team-plans" target="_blank">switch over to the paid team plan</a> whenever you’re ready.

### [Trial team plan vs. paid team plan](#trial-vs-paid-teams)

| Document editors/exporters | Up to 3 | Unlimited|
| Document viewers   | Unlimited    | Unlimited|

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are already a member of a free team (not the owner) and want to create a team with a paid plan, you’ll have to leave the free team first.</p>

## Managing teams

To **manage your team**, switch to the **Home** **tab**, then click the required team name in the left panel. The team screen will open up, featuring two tabs: [Projects](#projects) and [Members](#members).

### [Projects](#projects)

To start creating team documents, you’ll need at least one project to organize them. Think of projects as folders for your team’s documents.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="project" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/x3oezjCDwECLaS-udoDJTw.svg" width="844" /> 

All the documents within team projects automatically become available to all team members.

To **create a project**:

1. Select the required team in the left panel of the **Home** **tab**. Make sure you end up on the **Projects** tab.
2. At the top right corner of the screen, click **New Project**.
3. Name your project and press `Enter`.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="creating-project" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/txs4F1_xYEKOBjSbCfVczA.svg" width="844" /> 

You can now add documents to the project. Using the three prompts at the top of the project page, you can:

- Create new cloud documents.
- Import existing `.sketch` files.
- Import Figma files.

To **show/hide a project name** in the left panel, use the **Pin** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="pin_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/KxHRtwNdm0i00mSBZ7PF9g.svg" width="20" />) button at the top right corner.

To **rename a project**, use the context menu in the left panel or click over the project name in the main area. To **change the project avatar**, simply click on it.

To **delete a document** from a project:

1. Right-click the document to open up the context menu.
2. Select **Delete**.

Deleted documents move to the **Deleted** section of the **Home** **tab**. There, you can restore or permanently delete documents.

To **delete a project**:

1. Delete all documents from the project first.
2. Click the **Delete project** button at the top right corner.
    
    **OR**
    
    Right-click over the project in the left panel, then click **Delete** on the context menu.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all users can delete documents and projects. Check out the table below for details.</p>
</div>


### [Members](#members)

Use the **Members tab** to:

- Generate invite links for new members.
- Manage team members and their roles.
- Delete team members.
- Copy a link for a pending invite to resend it.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="team-management" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/sQhrXqgQV0q7xaZRBks1OA.svg" width="844" /> 

To create an invite link, click **Invite user** in the upper-right corner of the screen. The link ends up in your clipboard, and a new record appears in the list of team members. Until the invitee opens the link, you’ll see the **Invite pending** caption instead of their username. 

Once a user opens the link, their username and avatar will show up on the **Members** tab. You can visit team member profiles by right-clicking their avatars.

Use the drop-down list in the **Team permissions** column to assign **user roles** to team members:

**Can view**. Assigned by default to all users joining a team via an invite link. Users with this set of permissions can only view the content of team documents.

**Can export**. This is for developer handoff. Users with this set of permissions can view designs, inspect layer properties, and export document layers.

**Can edit**. Users with this role can create and edit team documents, but they lack certain administrative permissions.

**Admin**. Team admins can do all of the above, as well as rename the team, change its avatar, assign roles to other members, and delete members from the team.

#### [Role permissions](#role-permissions)

|  | Owner | Admin | Can edit | Can view | Can export |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Change the team plan | + | - | - | - | - |

### Deleting a team

To **delete a team**, right-click the team name on the left panel of the **Home** **tab**, then select **Delete**. Note that only the team owner can delete the team.

Deleting the team means that:

- All documents associated with the team move to the **Deleted** section of the **Home tab**.
- Team members lose access to the documents.
- The name of the team appears greyed out in the left **Home tab** panel. A right-click over a deleted team opens up the context menu that lets you either permanently delete the team or restore it.
