Many industries feel uneasy knowing that their data is floating somewhere in the clouds without proper control — banking, healthcare, insurance, you name it.

For design teams working in such fields, Lunacy offers a **Private Cloud** solution with two deployment options: **on-premises** and **virtual private server (VPS)**.

## Private cloud on-premises

For companies with a strong focus on security who prefer to keep all their data in-house. 

**How it works**

- You deploy your personal Lunacy Cloud on a dedicated server within your corporate network.
- You configure the teams and control who can edit or view certain documents.
- You take full care of the server and backups.
- Your administrator installs the updates after all the required checks.

**What you get**

- Total control over your design cloud.
- Happy design and other teams enjoying the perks that cloud collaboration brings.
- Happy security department since no data gets outside.


## Private cloud on VPS

This option is for the teams that don’t feel like sharing a common cloud with the rest of the world but aren’t quite ready to manage their own servers. 

**How it works**

- Our engineers deploy, configure, and update Lunacy Private Cloud for you on a virtual private server in any region or jurisdiction.
- You configure the teams and control who can edit or view certain documents.
- You make backups of your documents or delegate it to our engineers.
- Our engineers assist you with any technical matters as needed.
- Unlike users of privately hosted clouds, you can keep using built-in graphics and Lunacy’s AI tools.

**What you get**

- Efficient design team working in a modern collaborative design editor.
- Peace of mind about the security of your design data.
- No headache about managing your private design cloud.


Both solutions, Private Cloud on-premises and VPS, come with *24/7 priority support*, a *dedicated customer success manager*, and *priority feature requests*.
