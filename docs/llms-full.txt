# Auto layout

Learn how to create dynamic designs with auto layout

## Overview

**Auto layout** is a powerful feature you can use to create dynamic designs that adapt to the size of their contents.

For instance, if you create a labeled button with auto layout, changing the button text will resize the button depending on the width of the text:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_button.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_button.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

If you're familiar with auto layouts, for example the ones in Figma — auto layouts in Lunacy are pretty much the same. Here's a video explainer of the auto layout workflow in Lunacy:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwcMADxxrH0?si=7gVI3TqUc3jsAEm_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you need more info, all the details about auto layouts are in this section.


### The basics

The option to enable auto layout appears in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#working_with_the_right-panel" target="_blank">right panel</a> whenever you select a frame:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_inactive" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/YA58uerpykS3l4kmQ2iPmQ.svg" width="844" /> 


In Lunacy, you can apply auto layout to:

- **Layers in individual frames**. Auto layout settings apply to the layers inside the frame. Resizing these layers will affect the size of the frame (unless you specify otherwise).

- **Several frames**. To do this, put several frames into a container frame, then add auto layout. You can then define the arrangement of the child frames relative to each other.  

    Resizing the child frames will affect the container frame, but changes to layers inside the child frames won’t impact the container — unless the frames have auto layouts themselves, like in the following case.

- **Several auto layout frames**. You’ll be able to change auto layout properties for each frame, as well as the container frame they are [nested](#nested-auto-layouts) in.

    The overall layout will dynamically respond to changes inside the child frames.


#### Some things to keep in mind

1. All available auto layout properties are displayed in the right panel:

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_active" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/oPBxm-FrekaMFUrAJ-lwYA.svg" width="844" />  

    To view the settings for any auto layout frame, simply select it and refer to this section.


2. Before you apply auto layout to a frame, make sure you have coherently <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#grouping-layers" target="_blank">grouped</a> or framed your layers, otherwise your layout might get messed up. 

    In the example below, the top frame features two buttons with their text and background **ungrouped**. The bottom frame has **two groups** containing the elements for both buttons. Here’s how auto layout works for these frames:
    
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_grouping.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_grouping.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    Nothing unfixable by `Ctrl + Z`, but still an inconvenience.

3. You can add auto layouts to any frame with any kind of content: the frame can include just layers or a mix of <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/" target="_blank">layers</a> and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#frames" target="_blank">frames</a>. All the elements will be affected by auto layout settings unless you exclude them (for example, using absolute position, which we will go over below).

## [Creating an auto layout frame](#creating-auto-layout)

To **add auto layout** to a frame:

1. Select the frame.
2. Press `Shift + A` or click `+` next to **Auto layout** in the right panel.

To **place several layers into an auto layout**:

1. Select two or more layers.
2. Press `Shift + A`.

The **Auto layout** section will then display the various [properties](#auto-layout-properties) you can apply to your frame. 

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_settings_right" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/4PnutYRZi06Cat0B0jBupQ.svg" /> 

You can adjust the spacing and padding in an auto layout right on the canvas by dragging the pink handles between and around the elements.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/al_canvaseditor.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/al_canvaseditor.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Individual auto layout settings

Select elements within the frame to **change their individual auto layout settings**:

- If you select a nested auto layout frame, you’ll see the usual **Auto layout** section in the right panel.
- If you select an ordinary layer or frame inside an auto layout you’ll see its **individual properties**, which look like this:
    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_individual" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/OKuGC-Rf4U6uZ1qJCfj5kw.svg" width="844" /> 


## [Auto layout properties](#auto-layout-properties)

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_properties" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/LFv-N9G44E2xNXuBicy3Yg.svg" width="844" /> 

#### Resizing options

Determine how the container frame responds to changes made to layers inside it:

* Set height or width (or both) **Hug** if you want the frame to be resized depending on the size of its contents.
* Use the **Fixed** option if you want the frame to remain unchanged regardless of the size of its contents.

#### Layout orientation

Set a **vertical** or **horizontal orientation** for elements in an auto layout. Vertical orientation arranges elements along the **Y axis**, and horizontal orientation places them on the **X axis**. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_orientation.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_orientation.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To combine both these options, you’ll need to nest auto layout frames in a larger frame.


#### Alignment controls

Align your layers within the auto layout. Since alignment options will be determined by auto layout settings, this section of the right panel will be unavailable:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="alignment_disabled" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/f0DMpMmXpkCbCQ1xFSXCYg.svg" width="844" /> 

Change alignment by: 

- Clicking on the sections of the square outline or the lines in the middle.
- Dragging the alignment blocks to the border you need.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_alignment.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_alignment.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Element spacing

Define the spacing between elements in an auto layout by:

- Entering the values in the **Spacing** fields.
- Dragging the values in the fields up or down.
- Selecting the field and moving the mouse wheel (additionally hold down `Shift` to change the values in 10px increments).
- Selecting the field and using the arrow keys.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_spacing.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_spacing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Padding

Determine the distance from elements to the borders of the container frame. Adjust the value in the right panel just like with element spacing. 

#### Lock/unlock right and bottom padding

When you change left or top padding, right and bottom padding will mirror the new values. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="unlock_padding" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PpXulR2e9ECMC6HIzjsYIQ.svg" width="10" /> to change padding for individual sides. If you lock the padding again (click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="lock_padding" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/Ik9qCzk510aNl1A3Oi-Grw.svg" width="16" />) after changing values for individual sides, the altered padding values won't revert back to match the opposite side. Enter a matching value on one side of the padding to synchronize the values once more.

#### Distribution options

Control the way elements are distributed within the auto layout:
- With the **Packed** option active, you can freely change the spacing between elements and the padding around them. 
- **Distribute** creates equal spacing between elements depending on the padding. You will only be able to change padding values, while element spacing will be set automatically.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_distribute.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_distribute.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Stacking behavior

Determine how elements are stacked when spacing between them is negative. This is useful for designing elements that may overlap in a layout: avatar pictures, images, slides, cards, and so on. The default stacking option is **First on top**, meaning that the top layer in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#layer-list" target="_blank">Layer list</a> will be placed first in a stack. To reverse the order, set this option to **Last on top**:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_stacking.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_stacking.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Border inclusion

Include or exclude borders from an auto layout. This is useful when, for instance, you have shapes with thick borders in your design: you can set auto layout to apply to just the shapes while ignoring their borders. If borders are included, they will be considered as parts of the shapes:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_border.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_border.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This setting only affects the borders of the elements inside the auto layout, not the borders of the container frame.</p>
</div>
 
#### Remove auto layout

Remove the auto layout from the frame. The spacing and padding you applied to the frame using auto layout will remain, but all other auto layout settings will be removed. 

#### Individual layer properties
You can also **change the properties of layers** within your auto layout.

To do this, select a layer to open up its individual Auto layout properties. 

Here, you can:

- **Define the layer’s horizontal and vertical resizing behavior.**
    
    **Fixed** is the default option. You can freely change the size of the layer, and the auto layout will respond accordingly. 
    
    **Fill** makes the layer change its size proportionally when the container frame is resized. You won’t be able to manually resize the layer like with the Fixed option.

- **Set the layer to have an absolute position.**

    With [absolute position](#absolute-position) enabled, you can freely move the layer anywhere you want within the auto layout regardless of its general settings. It won’t be affected by any auto layout properties unless you disable it. 

    Once a layer has an absolute position, you’ll be able to set constraint options for it. Read in detail about those [below](#constraint-options).


## [Removing elements from an auto layout](#removing-elements-from-auto-layout)

To **remove an individual element from an auto layout** frame:

- Click on it and drag it out of the frame. The remaining elements will adapt to the change based on the auto layout properties.
- Select the element in the **Layer list** and press `Del`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_remove.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_remove.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## [Changing elements in auto layouts](#changing-elements-in-auto-layout)

This section goes over:

- How changes in individual elements affect the overall auto layout.
- The absolute position feature and how it excludes elements from auto layouts while keeping them in the frame.
- Constraint options and how they influence the behavior of elements in an auto layout.
- Adding and resetting component overrides in an auto layout.

### [Resizing auto layout elements](#changing-auto-layout-elements)

Auto layout frames will adapt to changes in child element size based on your settings. 

Here are a few examples of how an auto layout changes depending on the resizing options set for the container frame:


1. The width and height of the auto layout frame are set to **Hug**, so they change depending on the size of the layers inside it:

    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_changes_1.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_changes_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

2. Width is **Fixed**, and height is set to **Hug**. When the width of the elements changes, the width of the parent frame stays the same:

    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_changes_2.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_changes_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    Meanwhile, the frame’s height adapts dynamically when the height of the elements changes.

3. The width and height of the auto layout frame are **Fixed**, so they stay static regardless of the changing width and height of the layers:

    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_changes_3.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_changes_3.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### [Absolute position](#absolute-position)

To **detach an element from auto layout settings** and move it freely around the frame:

1. Select it in the **Layer list** or on the canvas.
2. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="absolute_position_" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/fgz1fAT4GUa2fJFFWt4kWg.svg" width="16" /> in the right panel. 

The element now has an **absolute position**. You can move it freely within the auto layout and keep it static regardless of any resizing changes, like in the video below.

Here, we're adding a logo to an article preview card. At first, we just dragged the logo into the frame. It became part of the auto layout, perfectly aligned along the existing text layers. However, we needed the logo at the top of the card, a bit to the left of the main layout with the texts:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_absolute.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_absolute.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### [Constraint options](#constraint-options)

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#resizing-constraints" target="_blank">Constraints</a> define resizing behavior for layers in groups or frames. They are also accessible for elements in auto layout frames that are set to absolute position.

Once you set a layer to have an absolute position, the **Constraints** section will open up in the right panel:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_constraints" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/pQUddBwtpkKNiqACoq5fKQ.svg" width="844" /> 

- The **Pin to Edge** controls pin a layer to one or several edges of the auto layout frame. This means that when you resize the frame, the distance between the layer and the edges it is pinned to will not change.
- The **Fix width** and **Fix height** checkboxes do just that: fix the width and/or height of an element in the auto layout. Whenever you resize the parent frame, the checked off properties won’t be altered. 


### [Auto layout overrides](#resetting-overrides)

You can add auto layouts to any <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/" target="_blank">component</a>. Combining [components and auto layouts](#auto-layouts-and-components) brings your workflow to the next level, making it easier to quickly change and update your designs. Read in detail about <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components" target="_blank">working with components</a>.

#### Resetting overrides

When you make **instances** of a component (i.e. duplicate a component), you can make changes to these instances, creating overrides that don't affect the style of the main component. 

You can reset all overrides by pressing the **Reset overrides** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg" width="16" />) in the **Component** section of the right panel. This reverts the instance to match the style of its main component once more.

However, when you modify auto layout properties for a component instance, the  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg" width="16" /> button also appears in the **Auto layout** section of the right panel.


Don't let this confuse you:

- The **Reset overrides** button appears in the Auto layout section when you make changes to the **auto layout properties** of a component. Click it to reset these properties and return them to the defaults of the main component.
- The same button appears in the **Component** section when you make changes to the **auto layout properties of a component** and/or to **distinct components in the auto layout** frame. Use it to reset **all overrides** for the component: both the auto layout properties and any individual component changes.

Here’s how it works:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/autolayout_reset_overrides.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/autolayout_reset_overrides.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

In the video, there are three component instances nested in a frame that itself is a component. We duplicate it and make changes to the new frame:

1. Changing the element spacing.
2. Changing the padding.
3. Changing the color of one of the button instances.

We then press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" /> in the **Auto layout** section to reset just the auto layout overrides (spacing and padding). We undo this, then press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg" width="16" /> in the **Components** section to reset all overrides (spacing, padding, **and** the button color).

## [Nested auto layouts](#nested-auto-layouts)

You can **nest several auto layout frames** in more complex auto layouts to design truly responsive interfaces. This way, you’ll be able to select any distinct element of your design and alter its settings so that the overall layout adapts to changes based on the settings you choose.

Here’s an example of how you can combine auto layouts for a simple news website:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout_nesting" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/jZBCAJSHrEOXKCEveQFTUA.svg" width="844" /> 

From the top down:

1. The **header** is a horizontal auto layout containing the logo, the top menu, and the search button. 
2. A smaller auto layout is nested in the header: the **top menu**, which contains links to the other pages of the website.
3. The **left sidebar** is a vertical auto layout.
4. More vertical auto layouts appear in the middle of the website: **news post previews** follow a strict format consisting of a picture, a title, and a subtitle.
5. Several **posts in a row** form a 4-post horizontal auto layout.


## [Auto layouts and components](#auto-layouts-and-components)

As we mentioned above, auto layouts are even more powerful when paired with components. For example, if each news post in the layout is an instance of a component, which itself has an auto layout:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="auto_layout_components" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/57IfsXZw7ka7LKTnvNUWug.svg" width="844" /> 


Changing the original, or main, component (either its element properties or its auto layout settings) will apply the changes to each instance:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="auto_layout_components_edit" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/fNthiKa0dUaYZjEjSuP_Hw.svg" width="844" />

An overview of Lunacy's basic features and capabilities

Learn more about Lunacy's features, interface capabilities, and useful tips and tricks to speed up your design process.

## [Working with the canvas](#working-with-the-canvas)

#### Navigation

If your design is taking up too much space on the canvas, use the mouse wheel to scroll vertically. To scroll horizontally, additionally hold down `Shift`.

Another way to navigate the canvas is to hold down `Space` to activate the **Hand** tool and drag the canvas to wherever you need.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/moving_around_canvas.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/moving_around_canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can always use the scroll bars on the right and bottom of the workspace, but it's not as convenient as the other options.


#### Zooming in and out

The easiest way to **zoom in and out** in Lunacy is by holding down `Ctrl` / `⌘` and moving the mouse wheel. To **zoom slower**, additionally hold down `Shift`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/zoom_in_canvas.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/zoom_in_canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When the zoom value exceeds 500, Lunacy displays a **pixel grid**. If you want to disable this feature:

1. In the menu bar, select **View → Pixel grid**.
2. Deselect all layers on the canvas and clear the **Show pixel grid** checkbox in the **right panel**.

Find out about other [zooming options](#zooming-options).

#### Changing the canvas color

1. Deselect all layers.
2. Use the **Workspace color** control in the right panel.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="canvas_color" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/TmFrkSpmxEi2Rb3deQBoLA.svg" width="844" /> 

Press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg" width="16" /> to reset the canvas to the default color.

You can also set the canvas color opacity to 0 so it becomes transparent. You'll see a checkerboard pattern instead of a fill.

## [Layer list](#layer-list)

Open the **Layer list** by clicking on the **Layers** content tab. It will display the layers on the current page:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PuPEDNTYvEKC5atXX-ylxQ.svg" width="844" /> 

Press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="smart_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/3uDOUlA760igh6dc4pOLLg.svg" width=16 /> to toggle the **Smart Layer list**, which displays only the layers you currently see on the canvas. It's convenient when you want to see only the layers you're working on in the Layer list.

Lunacy automatically assigns names to new layers and layer groups. You can always rename them if you like. 

If a layer name doesn't fit in the Layer list, you can change the width of the panel this way:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="" poster="/public/resize_layer_list.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/resize_layer_list.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Using the Layer list, you can:

|   Action    | Description |
|---------------------------------------|------------------|
|   Select layers      |    To select a layer or layer group, click its name in the Layer list. A selection frame will appear around the layer. To select multiple items hold down the `Ctrl` / `⌘` or `Shift` keys and click on the layers.    |
|   Search for layers                                 |    To locate a layer, start typing its name in the search field above the Layer list.    |
|   Arrange layers                |     Change the order of the layers in the list by dragging them up or down. Organize layers as you see fit and position them in the order you want them to be stacked if they're overlapping on the canvas. |
|  Hide layers                    |   To hide layers, layer groups, or individual items inside layer groups, select a layer and click the eye icon next to its name. You can also hide layers by using the `Ctrl + H` / `⌘ + H` shortcut or the corresponding option on the context menu.     |
|    Lock layers            |     Lock layers, grouped layers, or individual layers within a group to protect them from accidental edits. To do this, select a layer in the Layer list and click the lock icon, press `Ctrl + L` / `⌘ + L`, or use the corresponding option on the context menu. To select locked layers and edit their properties in the right panel, right-click them on the canvas or select them in the Layer list. |

## [Right panel](#right-panel)

There are two tabs at the top of the right panel: **Design** and **Export**. 

#### Design tab
The **Design** tab is the one you'll interact with the most when working on your designs. The set of controls and settings it displays depends on the type of the selected layer. These properties are universal for almost all layer types:

| Right panel properties &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |   
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

Also, on the **Export** tab, you can see the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/export/#code-preview-and-linked-design" target="_blank">displays the code corresponding</a> to selected layers.

#### Right panel properties with no selected layers

When all layers are deselected, the right panel shows these settings:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="inspector_no_layers" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/e7AGem3y7EyT38xi2QO2DA.svg" width="844" /> 

* **Workspace color.** Change the color of the canvas.
* **Show pixel grid.** Toggles the pixel grid on/off when the zoom value exceeds 500.
* **Nudge amount settings.** Nudge layers by moving arrow keys and set custom values for small nudges (using just the arrow keys) and big ones (arrow keys + `Shift`).
* **Color palette section.** Use it to generate various base color palettes for your documents.

If you need more space, you can hide the right panel panel by selecting **View → Right Panel** on the menu bar.

#### Changing values in the right panel

To **change values in the right panel** input fields:

* Type a value manually.
* Click over a field and use the mouse wheel to gradually increase or decrease the value.
* Hover the cursor over a field, wait a moment until the cursor turns into a double-headed arrow, and drag the cursor up or down.
* Enter an arithmetic operation.

## [Rulers and guides](#rulers-and-guides)

**Rulers** and **guides** help to position and align layers. 

#### [Rulers](#rulers)

Rulers are enabled by default and use pixels as a measurement unit. They appear at the top and on the left side of the canvas. 

To toggle rulers on and off, use the `Ctrl + R` / `⌘ + R` shortcut or select **View → Rulers** on the menu bar.

#### [Guides](#guides)

To create a guide, click anywhere on a ruler and drag the guide onto the canvas. You can now position layers along the guide. Moving a layer close to it snaps the layer to the guide.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/guides_on_canvas.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/guides_on_canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To move a guide, drag it to another position or select it and use arrow keys to nudge it. To remove a guide, click it (hold down `Shift` to select multiple guides) and press `Delete`. 

You can also open up all of these guide settings by right-clicking over a ruler:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="ruler_options" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/ZqUEc3AmlEqw1gm3TaeWVQ.svg" width=844 /> 

## [Grids](#grids)

Lunacy has **square** and **layout grids**. If needed, you can display both of them at the same time.

#### [Square grid](#square-grid)

If there are no frames on the canvas, Lunacy displays a square grid. Toggle it on and off by clicking the **Show/Hide grid** button on the right panel or pressing `Ctrl + '` / `⌘ + '`.

If you have frames on the canvas, use the same button to toggle grids on and off:

* **For each frame**. To do this, deselect all frames and layers on the canvas, then press **Show/Hide grid**.
* **For an individual frame**. Do the same with a frame or layer selected.

To set the size of grid cells, enter the desired value in the **Grid size** field.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/square_grid.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/square_grid.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### [Layout grid](#layout-grid)

Layout grids are useful for positioning design elements within your [frame](#frames). If you have several frames on a page, you can toggle layout grids on and off for them just like with sqaure grids, using the corresponding button in the right panel.

Each frame can have its own layout grid settings:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/layout_grid.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layout_grid.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Measuring distances

Lunacy has a variety of options for measuring distances between elements. The measurement option depends on whether a layer is distinct, grouped with other layers, or nested in a frame.


#### Individual layers

To **measure the distance between two layers**:

1. Select the first layer.
2. Hold down `Alt` / `⌥`.
2. Hover the cursor over the other layer.

To measure the **distance from a layer within a frame to the frame's boundaries**:

* Hover the cursor over the layer and hold down `Alt` / `⌥`.
* Select the layer, hover the cursor over an empty area within the frame, and hold down `Alt` / `⌥`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/measuring_distances_using_alt.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/measuring_distances_using_alt.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also use this function to **position layers in a precise location or relative to one another**:

1. Select one of the layers.
2. Point the cursor over an empty area or over another layer.
3. Hold down `Alt`/ `⌥` and move the selected layer using the arrow keys.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/aligning_using_alt.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/aligning_using_alt.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Grouped layers

Use the steps described above to measure the distances between:

* A grouped layer and layer.
* Two layers inside the same group.
* A grouped layer and the frame boundaries.

To measure the **distance between a layer inside a group and the group's boundaries**:

1. Point the cursor over a grouped layer.
2. Hold down `Ctrl + Alt` / `⌘ + ⌥`. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/measuring_group_elements_to_group_border.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/measuring_group_elements_to_group_border.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To measure the **distance between a layer inside a group and the borders of the frame where it's nested**:

1. Select a grouped layer.
2. Hold down `Alt` / `⌥`.
3. Point the cursor anywhere outside the other grouped layers.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/measuring_group_elements_to_frame_border.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/measuring_group_elements_to_frame_border.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To measure the **distance between two layers in different groups**:

1. Select a grouped layer.
2. Hold down `Alt + Shift` / `⌥ + Shift`.
3. Hover the cursor over a layer in the other group.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/measuring_distances_different_groups.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/measuring_distances_different_groups.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Here's a handy shortcut list for all of the distance measurement options:

| Element types         | Measurement option           |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | 
| Two separate layers     | Select the first layer, hold down `Alt` / `⌥`, and hover the cursor over the other layer.  |
| A layer inside a frame → the frame’s boundaries        | 1. Hover the cursor over the layer and hold down `Alt` / `⌥`.<br>2. Select the layer, hover the cursor over an empty area within the frame, and hold down `Alt` / `⌥`. |
| A grouped layer → individual layer         | Select the grouped layer, hold down `Alt` / `⌥`, and hover the cursor over the other layer. |
| Two layers inside the same group | Select the first layer in the group, hold down `Alt` / `⌥`, and hover the cursor over the other layer in the group.    |
| A grouped layer → frame boundaries    | Select the first layer in the group, hold down `Alt` / `⌥`, and hover the cursor over an empty area within the frame.            |
| A layer inside a group → the group’s boundaries         | Point the cursor over a grouped layer and hold down `Ctrl + Alt` / `⌘ + ⌥`. |
| A layer inside a group → the boundaries of the frame where it’s nested | Select a grouped layer, hold down `Alt` / `⌥`, and hover the cursor anywhere outside the other grouped layers.                   |
| Two layers in different groups   | Select a grouped layer hold down `Alt` / `⌥`, hover the cursor over a layer in another group.               |


## Zooming options

Use the **Zoom tool** and the **Zoom control** to explore more of Lunacy's zooming options.

The **Zoom tool** enables you to zoom in to a selected layer or canvas area. To use the tool:

1. Press and hold `Z`.
2. Click on a layer or drag over an area on the canvas (the smaller the area, the higher the zoom value).
3. To zoom out, hold down `Alt + Z` / `⌥ + Z` and click or drag over the layer/area.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/zoom_tool_options.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/zoom_tool_options.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The **zoom control** is on the right of the document tabs. To change the zoom value, you can:

* Manually enter a zoom value.
* Hover the cursor over the zoom control field, wait a moment until the cursor turns into a double-headed arrow, and drag the cursor up or down.
* Click over the zoom control field and move the mouse wheel.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/zoom_control.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/zoom_control.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also alter zoom options using preset values:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="zoom_control" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/E-VwOWodqUSaWk-_v6o86g.svg" width="844" /> 

Here are all the essential zoom options and corresponding shortcuts:

| Operation     | Description   | Windows shortcut      |        Mac shortcut       |
| -------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Zoom in/out | Zooms the canvas in/out. |  	`+/-` / `Ctrl + "+/-"`  |    `⌘ + "+/-"`        |
| Zoom to 100% | Sets the zoom value to 100%. | `Ctrl + 0` |       `⌘ + 0`       |
| Zoom to All Layers | Shows all the layers on the page. | `Ctrl + 1` | `⌘ + 1`            |
| Zoom to Selection | Zooms in and displays the selected layer in the center of the screen. | `Ctrl + 2`  | `⌘ + 2`            |
| Zoom to fit width | Zooms the canvas so that all horizontally distributed layers fit the screens. | `Ctrl + 3` | `⌘ + 3`          |
| Zoom to fit height | Zooms the canvas so that all vertically distributed layers fit the screen. | `Ctrl + 4`  | `⌘ + 4`        |

These options are also accessible through the **View** section on the menu bar:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="zoom_to" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/_0flAx2EaESsh5HNYbRCig.svg" width="844"/> 


#### [Show pixels on zoom](#show-pixels-on-zoom)

By default, Lunacy displays the canvas in the **vector mode**, which means that all layers (except for rasterized ones) will preserve their quality regardless of the zoom value. If you need to see individual pixels, you can use the **Show pixels on zoom** button. It displays pixels when the zoom value exceeds 100. 

Here is the same layer with the feature disabled (left) and enabled (right):

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="show_pixels" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/hjIJYiahiUaGtxr99Y6lGQ.svg" width="844" /> 


You can also toggle this feature on and off in the menu bar by selecting **View → Pixels on Zoom**.

## [Context menu](#the-context-menu)

The **context menu** appears when you right-click on a layer. The items on the menu vary depending on the layer you select. Almost all context menu options have shortcuts you can use to speed up your workflow.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="contextmenu" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/yDxxG6jz50yulSue63mF-g.svg" /> 



These context menu options are universal for almost all layer types: 

| Context menu button | Description | 
|---|---|
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Copy" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/hgirwJVu70qeG38ARiD5hQ.svg" width="16" />  | Copy the layer. |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Paste here" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/1F3Ipf6wM0qK5Saqv5Co3g.svg" width="16" /> | Paste an element at the position of the cursor. |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Duplicate" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/t-tMVYz1C0iX9YGOrhm_NA.svg" width="20" />      | Duplicate the selected layer.  |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Lock" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/BSGfdkIrBEOLaHjPnybBhw.svg" width="16" />             | Protect the layer from accidental edits.   |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Hide" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/kFaGjr3Qu0C8W7_Y_UjOXA.svg" width="20" />             | Hide the layer from the canvas.     |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Delete" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/7XSmNDmTIEu8s16n3TAT8w.svg" width="16" />           | Deletes the selected layer.   |
| Paste over   | Paste an element over the layer.   |
| Cut   | Cut the selected layer.   |
| Rename   | Rename the layer.   |
| Comment | Comment on the layer. |
| Copy/Paste as      | Opens a submenu with copy/paste options.      |
| Move to page      | Move the layer to another page in the document.      |
| Send to Back    | Move the layer to the bottom of the Layer list.      |
| Bring Forward   | Move a layer one step higher in the Layer list.   |
| Group Selection | Group two or more selected layers together. |
| Ungroup         | Ungroup a selected group of layers.  |
| Create component | Create a reusable component from the layer. |

When you right-click on an empty area on the canvas or a frame, the only option available on the context menu is **Paste here**.

### Context menu search

To quickly find the required menu option, you can use the search field at the top of the context menu. The search recognizes both English and your selected interface language.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> With the context menu search, you can find almost any command or shortcut, even those not related to the selected layer. You can even search by the first letters of commands. For example, typing 'cs' or 'c s' will return <i>Copy style</i>.</p>
</div>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/contextmenusearchman.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/contextmenusearchman.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


## Document pages

There can be any number of **pages** in a document. 

You can keep all your work on a single page or split it between several pages. For instance, when designing a website, you can keep the desktop and mobile versions on separate pages. 

Additionally, you can duplicate a page to save a version of your current design and experiment with the copy. It's completely up to you to decide which approach to choose. 

Here's what the **Page list** looks like: 

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="page_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/TgMw_XxCa025DzYKz7eF5Q.svg" width="844" /> 

It shows up above the **Layer list** when the **Layers** content tab is selected.

Use the Page list to:

* Add pages
* Rename pages
* Change the order of the pages
* Duplicate pages (with their content)
* Copy and paste pages into other documents
* Delete pages

To **add a new page** to the document:

1. Click the `+` icon above the Layer list.
2. Name the new page.
3. Press `Enter`.

To **change the position of a page** in the list, simply drag it to where you want it to be.

The rest of the actions are accessible through the **context menu**, which you can access by right-clicking a page name.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/page_add_rename.png" height="auto"><source src="/page_add_rename.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

There is also a special type of page — the **Components** page. It stores the reusable <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components" target="_blank">components</a>. you can create in your designs.

## Advanced privacy settings 

Turn off some or all of these features for a completely private experience:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="privacy_settings_advanced" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/vjjf-gYhsUGP7whMFN7eCw.svg" width="844" />

All users can disable Google Analytics and Google Fonts, and you can disable the rest of the features <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#personal-cloud-plan" target="_blank">with a subscription</a>. 


# Cloud documents
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/clouddocs.md

Learn how to work with and collaborate on cloud documents


In Lunacy, you can work with **local** and **cloud** documents. You can tell them apart by the icons next to their title:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="local-and-cloud-docs-difference" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/wLqQUPtoZUSZkvVmd9UOBg.svg" width="844" /> 

**Local documents** live on your computer. You can access and edit them even when offline.

**Cloud documents** are stored on Icons8 servers. They’re accessible and editable from any computer that has Lunacy installed and is connected to the internet.

Other advantages of cloud documents include:

- **Collaboration and file sharing.** [Collaborate](#sharing-cloud-documents) with other designers over the same project in real time or demonstrate your work to clients. Also, in [observer mode](#observer-mode), you can watch what other users are doing in real time.
- **Version history.** Track the [different versions](#version-history) of your document. You can save versions manually or use the ones Lunacy saves automatically after every 100 actions. This isn’t available for local documents.
- You can always [save them as local documents](#saving-cloud-as-local) if you need to.


<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your team is concerned about the security of their design assets, consider the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/private_cloud/" target="_blank">Private Cloud</a> option.</p></div>

## [Creating a cloud document](#creating-cloud-documents)

To **create a new cloud document**:

- In the menu bar, click **File → New Cloud Document**.
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` / `⌘ + Shift + N`.

To **share a cloud document**:

1. In the upper-right corner of the canvas, hover the cursor over the **Share** button to open the panel with sharing options.
2. In the dropdown menu on the left, choose whether you want to generate a **private** or **public link**.
3. Next to **Anyone with the link**, select what other users can do with the document:
    - **Can edit.** This option grants full access to the document, except they won’t be able to delete it.
    - **Can export.** Users can view and export selected objects or the entire document, as well as inspect the code of the elements in the document. For instance, you can grant export access to developers.
    - **Can view.** With this access level, users will be able to view the content in the document and copy elements to their own documents.
4. Click **Generate and copy link** and share it.

When invited users access your document, their avatars show up next to the **Share** button. You can individually modify their access level, temporarily ban, or remove them from the list:

# Components
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/components.md

Increase the speed and productivity of your design workflow with reusable components

**Components** are reusable design elements that speed up your workflow and keep your designs consistent. 

The main advantage of using components is that you can edit multiple instances of an element at once. For example, if you need to make a change to a button that appears in several places in your design, you can update the button **component** and the change will apply to all its **instances**:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_basics.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_basics.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## [Component basics](component-basics)

These are the basic terms related to components and their functions:

* **Main component**. The original layer that you convert into a component. 

* **Component instance**. You create a component **instance** any time you duplicate a main component. When you edit a main component, the changes apply to all of its instances at once.

* **Override**. When you modify an instance, you create an **override**. The main component won't be affected, and if you edit it later, the changes won't apply to instances with overrides.

* **Component page**. A dedicated document page used for storing main components. Lunacy adds it automatically when you create a component.

* **Component state**. Components from the same category or subcategory are called **component states**. They define the different styles for one component.

* **Nested components**. You can nest several components in a more complex component. This gives you the most freedom and flexibility in editing your designs, and it’s an even more powerful feature when coupled with <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/autolayout/#nested-auto-layouts" target="_blank">nested auto layouts</a>. 

## [Creating components](creating-components)

To **create a component**:

1. Select the layer you want to convert into a component.
2. Click `+` in the **Component** section of the right panel or press `Ctrl + Alt + K` / `⌘ + ⌥ + K`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/creating_components_methods.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/creating_components_methods.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also select a layer and click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="go_to_main" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/0yVpQqG2_kmdN0fYegHJ4g.svg" width="16" /> in the context toolbar at the top of the canvas or select the **Create component** option on the context menu.

#### Layers vs. Frames

When you create a component from a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/" target="_blank">layer or layer group</a>, Lunacy automatically frames it and transfers it to a separate Components page where it’s stored as a main component. An instance of the newly created component remains on the canvas.

If you create a component out of a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#frames" target="_blank">frame</a>, it will stay on the canvas as a main component, which you can then copy to create instances.

The difference is shown here:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_frame_layer_difference.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_frame_layer_difference.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Find out more about [component pages](#components-page).

#### Components and instances in the Layer list

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="components_instances_in_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/f8iTdn1orUiVLyZVImJClg.svg" width="844" /> 

Main components are bold and colored pink (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="color_code_F15085" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/b6VBjbQ0FEaLpb01JY4uEw.svg" width="12" />) in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#layer-list" target="_blank">Layer list</a>, and there’s a component symbol (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="main_component" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/JApz_Mo2XE6YIoPMoYA3ow.svg" width="16" />) in front of their name.

Component instance names aren’t bold but have the instance symbol (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="instance_icon" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/7zBFwNg0JEKWT8fAiIVn9A.svg" width="16" />) and the same pink color. When they’re selected, their properties and options appear in the **Component** section of the right panel.

## [Reusing components](reusing-components)

All the components in your document appear in the **Components tab** in the left panel.

To **add a component instance** to the canvas, drag it from the left panel to where you want to place it:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/reusing_components_left_panel.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/reusing_components_left_panel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Right-click a component in the left panel to bring up the context menu with these options:

- Rename component
- Edit component
- Delete component
- Duplicate component
- Group
- Expand all
- Collapse all

<div class="callout callout--info"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you used any components from built-in or manually created <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/#ui-kits" target="_blank">UI kits</a>, they will also appear in the Components tab.</p> </div>

## [Managing components](managing-components)

#### [Main component properties](#main-component-properties)

When you select a main component, the **Component** section in the right panel displays these properties:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="component_main_properties" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/NcGkZHpkfUadWBBYQjj0QA.svg" width="844" /> 

#### Component type

Select one of the presets to organize your components by type. 

<div class="callout callout--info"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> This setting currently has no visible effect. It’s reserved for future use in upcoming releases.</p> </div>

#### Resizing behavior

Choose whether to adjust the content of the component when it’s resized.

#### Color picker, opacity, and visibility

Set the component’s background color and show/hide it by pressing the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="eye_hide" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/Aa8CJl234kaxZXUTplkR4g.svg" width="24" /> / <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="eye_show" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/y6Qj385WoUu0be9H0CO3lA.svg" width="20" /> icons.

#### Include background in export

Include/exclude the component’s background when exporting it.

#### Include in instances

Include/exclude the component’s background in its instances.

#### [Components page](components-page)

You can use **Components page** that Lunacy generates automatically to store all of your main components. Alternatively, you can turn any page into a **Components page**:

1. Right-click the page in the **Page list**.
2. Select **Set as Components Page**.

<div class="callout callout--info"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you set one of your pages as a Components page, make sure its primary purpose is to store components. You’ll avoid confusion, and it will be easier to organize all of your design elements.</p> </div>

## [Component states](#component-states)

You can create several **states** for a component and switch between them as needed in the **right panel**. 

To **create a component state**:

1. Select a component instance.
2. Click `+` in the **Component** section of the **right panel** or press `Ctrl + Alt + P` / `⌘ + ⌥ + P`.
3. Adjust your component for the new state and name it.
4. Click on any empty area on the canvas.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/creating_component_state.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/creating_component_state.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

A new component will appear near the default main component, defining the new component state. 

Lunacy also changes the name of components when you create new states, automatically placing them into [categories](#organizing-components). You can edit categories anytime in the **Components tab**.

New component states for a distinct component will be displayed in the right panel as you select the component’s instances.

To **switch through component states**:

1. Select a component instance.
2. Choose the new component state in the **right panel**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/switching-component_state.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/switching-component_state.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Switching component states doesn’t affect overrides. This means that if you change the component state for an instance with overrides, the overrides you created will stay unchanged.</p> </div>

## Organizing components

As your document grows along with the number of components in it, you'll probably want to organize them so you can quickly find the necessary component when you need it. 

This is how componenet categories and subcategories appear in the **Components tab**:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="categories_components" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/TDamndg4PkCuDPWyD2wrEQ.svg" width="844" /> 

They also appear in the **Component state** dropdown menu in the right panel.

You can manually place your components in categories in the left panel (the **Group** option on the context menu) or use `/` in component names, like this: 

`Category name / Subcategory name /Component name`. 

Here's an example with just the category name and component name:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="button_components" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/VItNofN-PkGFXHrOt_lQIA.svg" width="844" /> 

Still, the quickest way to categorize your components is to create [component states](#component-states).

#### Deleting components

Delete main components from the **Components tab** (using the [context menu](#components-tab-context-menu)) or the **Components page** (simply delete the component frame). 

When you delete a component, all of its instances turn into frames.

## [Editing components](#editing-components)

You can **edit a main component**:

- In the **Component editor**.
- Directly in the **Components page**.

#### Making edits in the Component editor

1. Select a component instance and press `Enter` or choose **Edit component** in the context menu.
2. The main component will appear over the selected instance, while the rest of the canvas will be dimmed. The contents of the component will appear in the **Layer list**.
3. Edit the component.
4. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="exit_component_editor" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/CafkdkTnjUyKoai6_Ky0UQ.svg" width="16" /> on the context toolbar, click anywhere over the dimmed area, or press `Esc` to exit the component editor.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_components_1.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_components_1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Making edits in the Components page

1. Right-click on an instance and select **Go to Main Component** in the **right panel** or manually switch to the **Components page**.
2. Edit the required component.
3. Once you’re done:
    - If you used the **Go to Main Component** option, click the **Back to instance** button at the top left corner of the canvas.
    - If you manually opened the Components page, simply switch back to the previous page to continue working with the document.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_components_2.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_components_2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## [Swapping components](#swapping-components)

Use the **Components tab** or the **right panel** swap between instances from entirely different components. Simply select an instance you want to replace and use one of the following methods.

**Method 1**: 

1. Go to the **Components tab**.
2. Find the required component and click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="swap_components" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/FwHiX5HVcE23ZwIlDilhyw.svg" width="16" />

**Method 2**:

1. Open the **component state menu** in the **Component** section of the right panel.
2. Select the required category and component state.
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/components_swap_rightpanel.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/components_swap_rightpanel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    
## [Managing instances](#managing-instances)

We already covered how to create component instances to the canvas from the **Components tab**. You can also duplicate or copy/paste instances directly onto the canvas. 

With a main component or instance selected:

- Press `Ctrl + D` or `Ctrl + C → Ctrl + V`.
- Hold down `Alt`, then drag to place an instance on the canvas.

#### Component instance properties

For a component instance, the **Component** section in the **right panel** will look like this:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="rightpanel_instance" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/zztZgnyr9EqhG8-NFu-_hA.svg" width="844" /> 

#### Component state menu

A dropdown menu displaying the current state of the component. When open, it shows all other components and UI kits available in the document. 

If you didn’t create any component states, this property will read **Default State**. 

#### Component states

Select one of the presets to organize your components by type. Changing this for a component instance will affect its main component and vice versa.

#### Detach from component

Detach the instance from its main component or press `Ctrl + Alt + D` / `⌘ + ⌥ + B`.

#### Reset instance size

If you resized the instance, click this button to revert it to the size of the main component.

#### Go to main component

Redirects you to the instance's main component.

#### Component type

See the corresponding [main component property](#main-component-properties).

Once you modify an instance, the  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > button appears in this section, indicating that the instance has an override:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="instance_reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/5lHhTwB-kkq7WL8ZYDn_QQ.svg" width="844" /> 

Click it to **reset the override** and revert the instance back to the style of the main component. 


## Creating overrides

To reiterate, an override is any edit you make to a component instance. Let's go over them in detail.

Click `▾` next to the title of a component instance in the Layer list to expand its contents. You can modify all the layers inside it to apply the changes to **this component instance only**, creating an override:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="instance_in_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/qtjn2JJXVkixZRrCeXVMiA.svg" width="844" /> 

Some basic overrides you can make are changes to layer color, text, or image content.

Below, we have a simple example of a card component consisted of an image (an oval with an **Image** fill) and a labeled button. We make three types of overrides to the card, changing the **button color**, the **button label**, and the **image**. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/creating_simple_overrides.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/creating_simple_overrides.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can easily reset all of these overrides by pressing <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > in the **Component** section, like in the demo above. 

Here’s a full list of layers and properties you can create overrides for:

- Fills and images
- Text content and properties
- Layer and text styles
- Auto layouts
- Tints
- Hotspots

#### Understanding overrides

To understand how all of them work, we'll use more complex examples. Also, instead of making some overrides (like text and image edits) manually, we'll use some of Lunacy's handy time-saving features like <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#text-generation-and-text-snippets" target="_blank">text generation</a> and the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#avatar-tool" target="_blank">Avatar tool</a>.

One of the examples we'll use is this profile card UI:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="component_card_ui_elements" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/6BMwQzFTN0iOtpjr70XqOw.svg" width="844"/> 

All the components used in the layout are on the left, and their instances are nested in the profile card frame, which is a component itself.

When using complex components such as this one, you can easily change the states of the nested components, manually edit them, or modify all instances by adjusting the main component. 

#### Fills and images

The two images in the card are easily editable. The background behind the profile photo is a simple shape with an **Image** fill.

To change it in an instance, you only need to click it, then select the **color icon** in the **Fill** section and choose an image:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_fill_image.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_fill_image.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can do the same with the profile picture, provided it's a circle with an **Image** fill. To speed up the process, we recommend using Lunacy’s **Avatar tool** for placeholder profile pictures: simply press `Q` to place a randomly generated avatar picture directly onto the canvas. 

Now, when you make a component instance, a new avatar is generated automatically:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_copying_cards.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_copying_cards.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


#### Text content and properties

You can easily change the text and/or its properties in the component instance text layers. 

Use the **Text** section in the right panel to:

- Change the **content** of the text layer.
- Set new **fonts** and **text colors**.
- Edit **typographic properties**.
- Alter the text’s **advanced settings**.

##### Using generated texts
In the demo above, along with the avatar, nearly all of the texts changed to randomized placeholders as well. This is because most of the texts in the layout were generated by Lunacy’s text generation feature.

An extensive list of text generation options appears whenever you add a layer using the text tool (`T`). It creates randomized texts for your layouts so you don’t have to do the work yourself. Find out more about <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tips/#text-generation" target="_blank">text generation</a>.

So, when we were creating component instances in the demo above, new texts appeared automatically.  

#### Layer and text styles

In the main component, we used text and color styles to design our layouts. This is a convenient feature for keeping your designs consistent and easily editable. 

Simply switch styles, create new ones, or edit and delete existing styles in the **Style** section of the right panel:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="style_dropdown_menu" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/_1_XLrY8B0WTqyjneVrQaw.svg" width="844" /> 


#### Auto layout overrides

When you modify auto layout settings in instances, a **Reset overrides** button appears in the **Auto layout** section of the right panel:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="component_auto_layout_reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/nfoh4DzycUK4PGMjgu8Xrg.svg" width="844" /> 

Use it to reset **only the auto layout overrides** in an instance:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_auto_layout_instance.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_auto_layout_instance.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Press the same button in the **Components** section to **reset all overrides** in the instance, **including** overrides made to the auto layout. Read in more detail about <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/autolayout/#auto-layout-overrides" target="_blank">auto layout overrides</a>.

#### Tint overrides

A <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/styling/#tints" target="_blank">tint</a> is a property you can add to a layer group or component instance. It’s useful for adding color to elements with semi-transparent parts or complex icons.

Tint overrides are useful for designing tabs or panels with elements that can have different states expressed through different colors.

<div class="callout callout--info"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll need to add default tints before you can create tint overrides.</p> </div>

The demo below shows three instances of the same component. We applied a tint override to one of them, then moved to the main component and modified the default tint. The change applied only to the instances without the override:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_tint_overrides.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_tint_overrides.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When you apply an override, the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > button appears in the **Tint** section of the right panel. Use it to remove only the tint override.

#### Hotspot overrides

If there’s a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/prototyping/#hotspots" target="_blank">hotspot</a> in your layout, you can override its target frame.

#### None override

You can **hide a nested component** using the **None override** option.

To do this:

1. Select a nested component.
2. Open the component state menu in the **Component** section of the right panel. 
3. Choose **No Component**.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="override_no_component" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/1rNKrYADVkKFezruOa3PvA.svg" width="844" /> 

Lunacy will override the component with the so-called **none component**. Later on, you can always override the none component with any other component.

## [Components and auto layouts](#combining-auto-layouts-and-components)

You’ve seen how using components makes the design process faster and much easier. Adding auto layouts to the mix speeds things up even more. 

Creating components with auto layout, then nesting those in larger auto layout frames makes it easy to manage complex designs and quickly update them when needed. 

If any spacing or padding distances seem off or you’re still in drafting mode, using components and auto layouts is the fastest way to test different versions of your designs.

For example, there’s quite a few auto layouts in our profile card examples:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_auto_layout_main.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_auto_layout_main.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


## Component-related shortcuts and menu options 

To recap, here’s a list of context menu options and shortcuts you can use to work with components, along with corresponding shortcuts, if available.

#### Main component options

| Option   | Description   | Windows and Linux Shortcut / Menu Option | MacOS Shortcut / Menu Option |
| -- | -- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Create Component**           | Create a new component from a layer. You can also click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="go_to_main" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/0yVpQqG2_kmdN0fYegHJ4g.svg" width="16" /> in the context toolbar at the top of the canvas.      | `Ctrl + Alt + K`      | `⌘ + ⌥ + K`    |
| **Convert Component to Frame** | Right-click a main component and select the option to convert it into a frame. All of its instances will also turn into frames. | `Ctrl + Shift + Y`     | `⌘ + Shift + Y`              |

# Editing shapes
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/editing_shapes.md

Make sure that you know everything about working with shapes in Lunacy

**Shapes** are types of layers in Lunacy, typically created with the Shape tools.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="shape_tools" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/MFF7H7DsU0agZi_H2rC16g.svg" width="844" /> 

The tools include several pre-made shapes you can add by selecting the Shape icon on the toolbar — or simply by using shortcuts:

`R` — rectangle<br>
`R`, `R` — rounded rectangle<br>
`L` — line<br>
`L`, `L` — arrow<br>
`O` — oval<br>
`O`, `O` — triangle<br>
`O`, `O`, `O` — polygon<br>
`O`, `O`, `O`, `O` — star

Once you select the shape: 

- **Click** on the canvas to place it as a 100 x 100 shape (works for all shapes except for lines and arrows).
- **Click and drag** to adjust the shape’s size.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_the_shape_tool.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_the_shape_tool.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Find out more about <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#shape-tools" target="_blank">working with different types of shapes</a>.

You can also make shapes using the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#pen-tool" target="_blank">Pen</a> and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#pencil-tool" target="_blank">Pencil</a> tools. Create vector paths, then close them to make a shape outline you can then edit.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_drawing_shapes.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_drawing_shapes.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This section focuses on how to edit and transform the form of vector shapes using the standard layer **Edit mode**, on-canvas controls, Boolean operations, and the right panel. To learn about adding fills, borders, and effects to shapes and other layers, check out the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/styling" target="_blank">Styling</a> page.

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/" target="_blank">Layers</a>

## Edit mode

The most basic way to edit a shape is to use **Edit mode**:

1. Select the shape you want to edit, and press `Enter`. You can also double-click the shape or select <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Vector" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/WyS0eXZYh0an2lsuK79VlQ.svg" width="24" /> on the context toolbar.
2. The cursor will switch over to the **Pen** tool. You can drag the paths and vertices of the shape as you see fit, add new points and adjust their properties in the right panel.
3. Press `Enter` again or click on an empty area on the canvas to exit Edit mode.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_edit_mode.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_edit_mode.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## On-canvas controls for editing shapes

### Corner radius

**Round the corners** for any shape (except for the triangle) by dragging the handles at the corners of the shape on the canvas.

For **rectangles** or **rounded rectangles**, drag any of the handles at the corners to adjust their radius. To change the radius of an individual rectangle corner, hold `Alt` while dragging.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_rounding_rectangle_corners.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_rounding_rectangle_corners.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

For **stars** and **polygons**, drag the handle below the topmost corner of the shape.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_polygon_star_rounding.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_polygon_star_rounding.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Smooth corner radius

You can create rectangles and frames with perfectly smooth corners like in iOS interfaces.

To **switch between default round and smooth corners**, click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="smooth_corners" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/DQW0-LFVuUGjlW_U4pzKmA.svg" width="20" /> next to the corner radius button in the right panel.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="smooth_corner_radius" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/uOkgjIJUBk2x8bZNUnIgig.svg" width="844" /> 

### Arc editor

With the **Arc editor**, you can quickly create rings and semirings, design pie charts or other fancy circular elements.

Draw an oval and use the handles in the middle of the shape to adjust its sweep and ratio. **Sweep** creates a gap in the oval, while **Ratio** changes the oval into an arc. Once you change the sweep, the **Start** handle will also appear on the shape, indicating where the arc begins.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_arc_editor.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_arc_editor.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Transforming stars and polygons

You can change the shape of stars and polygons right on the canvas without reaching into the right panel.

To **change the ratio** of a star, drag the handles at the inner intersection points of its sides.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_star_ratio.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_star_ratio.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To **change the number of corners** in a star or polygon, drag the handle below the shape’s top right corner.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_polygon_star_count.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_polygon_star_count.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> For shapes with distinct corners created with the <b>Pen</b> tool, you can only adjust the corner radius. This option will only be available in the right panel, these shapes won’t have any on-canvas handles.</p>
</div>

## Editing shapes through the right panel

Use these fields in the **right panel** to transform shapes: 

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="shape_right_panel_controls" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/RrEmGfMEzU6sq11URaYMGg.svg" width="844" /> 

The transform options mirror the on-canvas controls:

**Corner radius.** Rounds the corners of a shape. Available for most of pre-made shapes, except for ovals, triangles, lines, and arrows.

**Count.** Adjusts the number of points for stars/the number of angles for polygons.

**Ratio.** Changes the ratio of a star or oval.

**Sweep.** Creates a gap in an oval.

**Start.** Determines the starting point of an arc made from an oval.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_right_panel.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_right_panel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


## Vector editing

This section expands on **transforming vector shapes and paths** with **Edit mode**.

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before diving in, make sure you have a good understanding of how the Pen tool works. Read about the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#pen-tool" target="_blank">Pen tool</a> in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/" target="_blank">Tools</a> page to get a hang of the structure of vector layers, paths, point and curve types.</p>
</div>

In general, vector editing is all about manipulations with points and paths:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="edit_mode_controls" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/9CJx-Y0hRkORso6IgKEemg.svg" width="844"  /> 

- To **select a point**, just click it. To select multiple points, drag over them or hold down `Shift` when clicking several points.
- To **move a point**, select and drag it. This works with multiple points selected as well.
- To **add a new point** to a path, hover the cursor over the path, then click it to place a straight point or double-click to place a mirrored point.
- **Switch between point types** in the **Edit shape** section of the right panel.
- To **bend paths**, use curved points.
- To **round the corner** above a straight point, use the corner radius field. It only becomes active when you select a straight point.
- To **delete a point or several points**, select it/them and press `Delete`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_vector_editing.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_vector_editing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Boolean operations

Use **Boolean operations** to combine shapes into more complex forms:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="boolean_operations" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/Kx4z4ujxMUu4AQbxm7qLOw.svg" width="844" /> 

1. Select two or more overlapping shapes.
2. On the **context toolbar**, select the Boolean operation you need.

- **Union.** Creates a shape from the sum of the areas of the selected shapes (`Ctrl + Shift + U` / `Ctrl + Shift + U`).
- **Subtract.** The opposite of Union. Removes the overlapping area(s) from the shape layer at the bottom of the selection (`Ctrl + Shift + P` / `Ctrl + Shift + P`).
- **Intersect.** The resulting shape only includes the area where all selected shapes overlap (`Ctrl + Shift + I` / `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
- **Difference.** The opposite of Intersect. Creates a shape from the areas where the selected shapes do not overlap (`Ctrl + Shift + X` / `Ctrl + Shift + X`).

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_boolean.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_boolean.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When you apply a Boolean operation, the selected shapes become a Boolean group, this is how it looks in the Layer list:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="boolean_group_in_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/VOb_mVLhFEysnYBkItrHcg.svg" width="844" /> 

The icon next to the title of the shape layers indicates the type of the Boolean operation applied to the layer. Click it to open up a menu where you can select another operation or remove Boolean operations entirely.

You can select individual shapes within the group through the Layer list or on the canvas. If necessary, you can move and resize them on the canvas to modify the resulting shape.

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Tip:</strong> There is no button or shortcut to disassemble a Boolean group, but you can drag shapes out of the group in the Layer list. Read the full list of useful Lunacy tips and tricks.</p>
</div>

## Flatten selection

The **Flatten selection** operation is another method of creating complex forms by combining two or more primitive shapes. It’s similar to the Boolean Union operation, the difference being that the result of flattening is a single layer that cannot be disconnected.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_flatten_selection.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_flatten_selection.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The **Flatten selection** option appears on the **context toolbar** and is also available in the **Layer** section of the **menu bar**.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="flatten" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/2kTVePjMxUW4h91CwQ6mww.svg" width="844" /> 

## Masks

Use **masks** to display parts of layers and hide the rest.

To **create a mask**:

1. Add the shape you want to use as a mask to the canvas.
2. Place it below the layers that will be masked (you can leave it on top if it's a photo).
3. Select the mask shape and the target layer(s).
4. On the **context toolbar**, click the **Toggle mask** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="toggle_masks" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/7jpzF3Z3aUqytnbWOY6_jw.svg" width="20" /> 
) or press `Ctrl + M` / `⌘ + M`. The option is also available on the context menu.

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> When you're masking a shape with another shape, the layer you want to act as a mask should be placed below the layer that will be masked. If you're masking out part of a photo, however, you can leave the masking shape on top. </p>
</div>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_mask.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_mask.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When you apply a mask, Lunacy creates a mask group:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="mask_in_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/8POOmnt8DkyVzP9Q8QDI0w.svg" width="844" /> 

You can select the mask shape right within the group and move, edit, or resize the mask.

To remove a mask, select the mask group in the **Layer list** or on the canvas and press `Ctrl + M` / `⌘ + M`.

### Outline stroke

The **Outline stroke** command (`Ctrl + Shift + O` / `⌘ + Shift + O`), when applied to shapes, converts borders into separate layer. It appears on the context menu when you select a shape that has a border (you can also find the option in the **Layer** section of the **menu bar**).

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/editing_shapes_outline_stroke.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/editing_shapes_outline_stroke.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also use this command to <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#converting-text-to-outlines" target="_blank">convert text layers to vector outlines</a>.

## Rasterizing vector shapes

You can rasterize any vector layer in Lunacy to create pixel images (when you need elements as simple images, for example).

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="rasterize_selection" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/B949r6KJQkCQKUS2Lvo40w.svg" width="844" /> 

To **rasterize any shape** (or path):

1. Select it.
2. Right-click the selection, then select **Rasterize selection** on the context menu.

This option is also available in the **Layer** section of the **menu bar**.


<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that you cannot convert a raster back into a vector shape. <code>Ctrl + Z</code> / <code>⌘ + Z</code> will always help you out, though.</p>
</div>

- Individual or multiple <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/" target="_blank">layers</a> and layer groups (separately or as a single image)
- <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#frames" target="_blank">Frames</a> (with and without the frame background)
- Content within <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#slice-tool" target="_blank">slices</a>
- <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#document-pages" target="_blank">Document pages</a>
- Entire documents

With a single export operation, you can get multiple files of different formats and sizes. 

**Supported formats** include:

| Format type | Supported formats                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Raster      | `PNG`, `JPG`, `ICO`, `WEBP`, `GIF` |
| Vector      | `SVG`, `PDF`                       |

You can save exported files **to your computer** and also [upload your layers](#cloud-export) to **Lunacy Cloud**, generating a shareable link right to the layer in the document.

## Basic export rules

1. During export, Lunacy **ignores:**
    - Guides
    - Square and layout grids
    - Frame names
    - Prototyping arrows
    - Canvas color (not to be confused with frame background color)
    
    There is no way to include these elements into exported files.
    
2.  If there is **at least one frame** in your document, when you use the **Export Document** option, Lunacy will ignore all **layers located outside of frames**, as well as **main components**.
3. The **maximum height and width** of resulting raster files is **16,000 pixels**.

## Export settings

Open the **Export** tab to export a layer or the entire document: 

1. Select a layer (or several) or deselect all layers if you’d like to export the document.
2. Click `+` next to the **Export**/**Export document** section.
3. Adjust the export options, then click the **Export Selected**/**Export Document** button.

All export options, including advanced export settings, are displayed in the **Export** section. Its appearance depends on what you select on the canvas. 

With a layer selected, you will see these settings:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_section_layer" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/fcCzjZUPCUK2tQ8KtEPPdA.svg" width="844" /> 


#### Export size

By default, Lunacy exports layers at their original size (**1x**). You can change it to any of the preset scales or set your own (e.g., 8x, 10x, or 0.3x).

#### Prefix/Suffix

Defines the suffix or prefix of the export's file name. For any export size larger than 1x, Lunacy generates a default a default `@<size>` suffix, but you can enter your own in the input field (use only letters and numbers).

#### Format

Choose any of the available export formats. When exporting to `SVG` or `PDF`, you won’t be able to adjust the export size. It will be 1x by default.

#### Publish to Web

Publish any layer to **Lunacy Cloud** and get a shareable link to it. Read in detail about [working with cloud uploads](#cloud-export).

#### Show all cloud uploads

Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_show_uploads" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/zJT7IKTmPkmdulIMGf5Zag.svg" width="20" />  next to the **Export** section title to open up the **Cloud Uploads** subsection.

#### Add export option

Click `+` to add another export option. This lets you export the same element in different formats, sizes, and other settings. 

#### Remove export option

Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="delete_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/kZ6IazBibE-dMPVUiDhphA.svg" width="16" /> next to an export option to remove it.

#### Additional export options

Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="additional_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/__EaplTjMEWsdoU7Lq0nSg.svg" width="16" /> to open up additional export options. Here, you can:
- Choose a preexisting export preset.
- Create a custom export preset.
- Remove all export options.
- Create a slice to export a part of the selected layer or frame. 

<div class="callout callout--info"> <p><strong>Note:</strong> When nothing is selected, the <b>Export document</b> section opens up. All the settings are the same, except for the <b>Upload to Cloud</b> option, which isn't available.</p> </div>

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_document" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/_FLjfZSJmUObT0lCpeizDw.svg" width="844" /> 

## Export presets

An **export preset** defines specific export settings that you can reuse across your documents. You can use built-in presets or create your own.

Presets are especially useful when, for example, you consistently need to export UI prototypes in specific formats and sizes for your clients, you won't need to manually adjust the settings each time you export the designs. 

#### Creating an export preset

You can do this by:

- Saving current export settings as a preset
- Defining export settings for the preset in the **Additional settings** menu

To **save current export settings**:

1. Define the required export settings for your design in the **Export** section of the right panel.
2. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="additional_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/__EaplTjMEWsdoU7Lq0nSg.svg" width="12" /> next to the section title to open up additional options.
3. Select **Create preset**, name it, and click **Save**.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_preset_editor" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/goHqEjhd8kqHbGYRFOxKHw.svg" width="844" /> 

To **define export settings for a preset**:

1. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="additional_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/__EaplTjMEWsdoU7Lq0nSg.svg" width="12" /> next to the **Export section** title. 
2. Select **Create preset**.
3. Define the export settings, name your preset, and click **Save**. Create as many presets as you need.
4. You can use the preset for the current and future exports.

## Exporting elements from Lunacy

#### Exporting single and multiple elements

To **export a single element**:

1. Select the element (a layer, frame, component, etc.)
2. Open the **Export** tab and click `+`.
3. Define the **export settings** or use a **preset**.
4. Click `+` again to more export options if needed.
5. Click **Export Selected**.
6. Choose the export folder.
7. Once the export is complete, you’ll get an ‘Export completed’ popup with the prompt to open the file location so you can view the resulting exports.

To export **multiple elements**:

Exporting multiple elements is no different. The **Export as Single Image** checkbox will appear in the settings so you can choose to export selected elements in a single file:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_multiple_no_options" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/-r2x0eNdxkelLGqoSNH6HQ.svg" width="844" /> 

Also, when you select multiple layers or frames that already have defined export settings, you will see a **Click `+` to replace mixed content** message in the **Export** tab. Click `+` to clear the export settings for all elements and define new ones:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_multiple" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/nDYzbp9wBUOP0S0VUhrykg.svg" width="844" /> 

#### Including frame backgrounds in exports

When you set a background for a frame, its properties in the **Design** tab will have the **Include in export** checkbox. 

Select it if you want the background to be visible in the exported file.

#### Using slices for export

**Slices** are special layers you can use to export certain parts of your designs.

To **add a slice** to the canvas:

* Select the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#slice-tool" target="_blank">Slice tool</a> in the toolbar or press `E`. Your cursor will change to the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="slice_tool" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/OhVzbUI8FEaPsLz8lm2ulg.svg" width="16" /> icon. Click and drag to create a **slice**, which you can adjust to include parts of the elements you want to export.
* When defining export options for the element, select **Create slice** in the **Additional export options** menu.

When you select a slice, two additional settings appear in the **Export** section:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_slices" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/NottP8HlE0SSMVVRZs9AYw.svg" width="844" /> 

**Trim Transparent Pixels**. With this option enabled, Lunacy crops out unnecessary transparent pixels within the slice. This can be useful when you’re creating slices by hand using the **Slice** tool.

**Background**. Defines the background color that appears in place of transparent pixels in the export file.

To **export the content of a slice**:

1. Select one or multiple slices.
2. Export it just like any other element, taking into account the **additional settings** for slices.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_exporting_a_slice.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_exporting_a_slice.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To show/hide slices on the canvas, select or deselect the **Slices** option in the **Additional options** menu from the top bar:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_slices_enable_disable" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/vbxh7ACcEUKpMIgdJ7ccVA.svg" width="844" /> 

#### Exporting document pages

To **export all of the content in a document page**:

1. Use the `Ctrl + A` / `⌘ + A` shortcut to select all layers and frames on the page, **except for locked layers**.
2. Export it like any other element.

#### Exporting documents

There has to be at least one frame inside the document if you want to export it. Also, keep in mind that when exporting a document, Lunacy ignores, **layers that are not framed** and **main components**.

When exporting documents, Lunacy creates folders with names corresponding to the names of the **document pages**. Inside these folders, Lunacy creates **separate files for each layer** available on the respective page. Grouped layers and component instances are considered single layers.

To **export a document**:

1. Press `Esc` to deselect all layers. 
2. Click `+` next to **Export Document** in the **Export** tab.
3. Export it like any other element.

The **Suffix/Prefix** and **Publish to Web** options are unavailable for document exports.


## [Cloud export](#cloud-export)

You can **upload your designs** to Lunacy Cloud and instantly share them with other people:
1. Select the layer you want to export.
2. Define the **export settings** or use a **preset**.
3. In the **Export** section of the **right panel**, press the **Publish to Web** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="export_upload_to_cloud" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/RZuTFd-iZ0mo25jqpPuRGg.svg" width="24" />). 
4. The **Cloud export history** list will appear below, displaying all previous uploads, starting from the most recent.

### Is Lunacy really free?

Yes. Lunacy is absolutely free: there’s no hidden charges, ads, or locked features. 

Our built-in <a href="https://icons8.com/" target="_blank">graphics</a> (icons, photos, and illustrations) are also free for use in personal and commercial projects, as long you include a link to Icons8. You can purchase a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#graphics-subscriptions" target="_blank">paid subscription</a> to use them without link attribution and get access to higher resolution icons and pictures.

We also have <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#personal-cloud-plan" target="_blank">professional plans</a> for users and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/teams/" target="_blank">teams</a> that offer more powerful options for working with <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/clouddocs/" target="_blank">cloud documents</a> and collaborating with others.

### Do I need an internet connection to use Lunacy?

Not always. You can work on local `.sketch` documents on your computer without an internet connection.

However, you’ll need to be online to access your cloud documents or work with the content in our built-in <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/" target="_blank">Libraries</a>.

### Can I downgrade Lunacy to a previous version?

Yes. To do this:

1. Uninstall Lunacy.
2. Download the required version and install it. The full list of versions with links to installers is <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/release-notes/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### How can I be sure that I won’t lose my work if Lunacy crashes?

Lunacy has a mechanism that auto-saves all of your actions, both for local and cloud documents. If Lunacy suddenly crashes, it will re-open the document right where you stopped. 

### Why does my antivirus flag Lunacy as suspicious?

There are no viruses or spyware in Lunacy. In some rare cases, false positives might occur.

If you installed Lunacy from the Microsoft Store, keep in mind that apps can’t appear in the Store until they’re thoroughly checked for malicious code.

If you downloaded Lunacy from our website and want to make sure everything’s OK, you can upload and scan the installer at <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a>. It is a free, reliable online antivirus service.

After that, make an exception for the Lunacy installer and/or the app in your antivirus so that it runs smoothly.

### How do I report a bug?

Contact us via our feedback form: 

1. Select **Help** → **Report a Problem** in the menu bar. 
2. Describe the problem in detail so we can reproduce it and determine the cause.

**Memory dump files** contain useful information about bugs and malfunctions such as crashing and freezing events. Here's how you can <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/troubleshooting/" target="_blank">find them on your OS</a>. Attaching them to your report helps our team determine and fix the issue much faster.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a problem appears only in one specific document, please attach it to the report. Your content is safe: we will delete the file from our system after investigation.</p>
</div>


### Are you planning to go open source?

**Short answer:** Not at the moment.

**Long answer:** We realize this would speed up the development process, however, it would also slow us down in some ways, too. Sometimes, a small team can advance faster than a large community. We may reconsider in the future.


## Questions about features

Questions about existing or upcoming Lunacy features.

### Where can I get plugins?

We removed support for external plugins in <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/release-notes/#version-8" target="_blank">version 8.0</a>. That was a trade-off we had to make to release Mac and Linux versions. 

We’re going to restore the feature in an upcoming release.

### Can I enhance Lunacy’s performance by adjusting video card settings?

If your computer has a discrete video card, you can adjust your graphics settings so that Lunacy always uses the discrete card.

These steps will work for the majority of Windows 10/11 computers:

1. Go to **Start → Settings → Display → Graphics settings**.
2. Click **Browse** and find the `Lunacy.exe` file (default path: `C:\Program Files\Lunacy\Lunacy.exe`).
3. Click **Options** and set the **Graphics preference** to **High performance**.

![nvidia_settings](public/nvidia_faq_2@2x.png) 

If you are running an older Windows version, you can try to do the same using your video card control panel. Here are the required settings for an NVidia card:

![nvidia_settings](public/nvidia_faq_1@2x.png) 


<div class="callout callout--info">

### Where is the suggestions panel?
We decided to revamp the suggestions panel. We’ll add the new version to an upcoming release.

## Questions about possible issues

If you run into a problem with Lunacy, chances are, you’ll be able to fix it by yourself. Below is a list of problems that may arise and workarounds for them.

### Lunacy won't start. What do I do?

There may be several reasons for this. Make sure that:

- Your operating system is up-to-date. 
- The OS you are using is compatible with Lunacy. The app is intended to run on Windows 10 and 11, Mac OS, and Linux. You can try to run it on Windows 7 and 8, but we don’t guarantee Lunacy operating smoothly on these versions.
- You are not using an <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/stop-receiving-insider-builds-for-windows-10-be2c37cf-ae6e-c654-a6df-b3ebbcdc3404" target="_blank">insider build</a>.
- The latest stable version of your video card driver is installed.
- Your user account has enough rights to run applications. Try to run Lunacy as an administrator.
- Lunacy isn’t being blocked by your antivirus. Disable virus protection and try to launch Lunacy.

### Lunacy is slow. How do I speed it up?

These are the most common reasons for Lunacy running slow:

- **Too many large images in a document.**
    This often happens when you import a lot of high-resolution images and then shrink them to the required dimensions.
    
    *Workaround:* Replace the images with optimized copies.
    
- **Too many shadow and blur effects.**

    *Workaround:* Avoid excessive usage of shadows and blurs.
    
- **Too much heavy content on one page.**

    *Workaround:* Split up your project into several <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#document-pages" target="_blank">document pages</a>. This isn’t only useful for optimization, but for organizing distinct parts of your designs as well.
    
- **Large amount of text converted to outlines.**

    *Workaround:* Avoid converting large blocks of text (long sentences or paragraphs) to outlines.

### Why is the content in Lunacy Libraries not loading?

It might just be a problem with your internet connection. First, check it to make sure it's stable.

If it is, contact us via our feedback form and we’ll quickly fix the issue with the Libraries (**Help** → **Report a Problem**).

### A document I was working on is broken and/or won't open. How do I fix it?

To fix this:

1. Make sure you have the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/release-notes/" target="_blank">latest version of the app</a> installed.
2. Select **Help** → **Open App Data Folder** in the menu bar. This will open up a folder with Lunacy files.
3. Open the **Documents** folder. It contains subfolders with all of the documents you previously worked on. For convenience, you can sort them by the **Date modified** column.
4. Try to remember the date when you last modified the document, then drag and drop the subfolders with that modification date onto the canvas. Lunacy will restore the document.


If it’s a **local** document, its temp file `.lunTempFileSave` may not have been saved as a proper document. To restore it:
1. Follow the steps above to find it in the **Documents** folder. 
2. Change its extension to `.sketch` and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#opening-documents" target="_blank">open it</a> in Lunacy.

If it’s a **cloud** document, you can also open up its <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/clouddocs/#version-history" target="_blank">version history</a> and restore one of the saved versions:

1. On the **Home Tab**, right-click the document’s preview to open up the context menu.
2. Click **Show Version History**.
3. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="version_history_open" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/Hgz3YLF-okWyUSUU5QNtIA.svg" width="16" /> to open the previous versions of the document.
4. Choose the required version and click **FIle → Save** in the menu bar to save it as a local `.sketch` file on your device.
5. <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#importing-local-sketch-files-to-cloud" target="_blank">Import it</a> back into Lunacy Cloud.

If the problem persists, contact our support team (**Help** → **Report a Problem**) and attach an archive with the **Documents** folder to the report. If Lunacy crashed when you tried opening the document, attach an archive of the **Logs** folder as well.

### I lost a local temp file that was never saved as a `.sketch` document. Where is it?

1. Select **Help** → **Open App Data Folder** in the menu bar.
2. Open the **Documents** folder and sort the folders there by the **Date modified** column.
3. Drag and drop the top folders in the list into Lunacy. One of these is your unsaved temp file.

### Why is there a ‘No connection’ message in the left panel instead of icons?

An issue in **version 8.7.2** that we fixed in our latest beta build. Install it using one of these links:

* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/LunacySetup_x86.exe">Windows 32bit</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/LunacySetup.exe">Windows 64bit</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.pkg">MacOS .pkg</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.dmg">MacOS .dmg</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.deb">Linux deb64beta</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.ARM.deb">Linux debARMbeta</a>

Later on, if you decide not to update to further beta versions, select **Help** → **About**, then clear the **Check for Beta Updates** checkbox.

### Why are layers and images on the canvas stretching and flickering when I scroll and zoom?

This is a known issue that usually occurs on Windows 10 computers with Intel CPUs and specific video card models (for example, the GeForce RTX 20 Series).

To fix this:

1. Install the latest stable version of your **video card drivers** from the manufacturer’s website.
2. Install the latest update of the **Intel chipset driver** from the manufacturer’s website.
3. Make sure that your operating system is up-to-date.

If that doesn’t help:

1. Open the **Task Manager** and select the Services tab.
2. Stop the `Nahimic` service (an audio service).
3. Restart Lunacy.

If this works, report the problem to the manufacturers of your video card and motherboard. If not, contact our support team (**Help** → **Report a Problem**).

### Advanced troubleshooting

If the issue persists, we may need to investigate memory dump files to pin down the problem.

Optimize your work with images in Lunacy

This section covers how to work with raster images.

Lunacy supports these image formats: `PNG`, `JPG`, `JPEG`, `WEBP`, `BMP`, `ICO`, `GIF`, `SVG`. The `TIFF` format is not supported.

## [Adding images to the canvas](#adding-images-to-the-canvas)

There are several ways to **add images to the canvas**:

- Using the **Image tool** to add images from your computer
- Importing images from Lunacy’s **Photos** library
- **Drag-and-dropping** images from the file explorer
- **Copying images** from your desktop or browser and paste it onto the canvas
- **Importing images** from your web browser via link

#### Using the Image tool

To add images via the **Image tool**:

1. Press `M` or select the **Image tool** on the toolbar.
2. In the **Open** dialog box, choose one or multiple image files.
3. Click on the canvas to place the image to add the image in its original size or click and drag to adjust the image size before placing it on the canvas.

#### The drag-and-drop method

You can always simply **drag and drop images** from your files into Lunacy.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/images_drag_and_drop.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/images_drag_and_drop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Alternatively, you can right-click on an image in your file explorer or browser and select **Copy image**, then simply paste it onto the canvas.

#### The Photos library

To use **images from the Lunacy Photos library**:

1. Open the **Photos** tab in the left panel.
2. Choose an image, then **drag and drop** it onto the canvas.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/images_photo_library.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/images_photo_library.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use low-res photos, PNG icons, and illustrations for free as long as you include a link to <a href="www.icons8.com" target="_blank">icons8.com</a> in your final work.<br><br>To access <b>high-res photos and editable SVGs</b> without mandatory attribution use our graphics without mandatory attribution, consider our <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#graphics-subscriptions" target="_blank">graphics subscription</a>.

</div>

#### Importing images from the browser

There are two ways to **import an image from your browser** via link:

- Right-click the image in your web browser and select **Copy image address** from the context menu. Switch to Lunacy, press `M` for the **Image tool**, then paste the image URL in the file name input field. Finally, click **Open**.

    OR

- Right-click the image in your web browser and select **Copy image address** from the context menu. Switch to Lunacy, right click over the canvas, and select **Paste here** from the context menu. Click **OK** in the Paste as image dialog box. If you click **Cancel**, Lunacy will paste the text of the image address.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This method works only when a web site provides direct links to images with an image extension at the end (<code>.jpg</code>, <code>.png</code>, etc.)</p>
</div>

### Adding image fills

You can also add images directly to your <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/" target="_blank">layers</a> (including <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/editing_shapes/" target="_blank">shapes</a>, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#frames" target="_blank">frames</a>, and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text" target="_blank">text</a> layers). They will act as a layer background you can replace or modify anytime.

To **add an Image fill**:

1. Make sure your layer has a fill. If it doesn’t, click `+` next to the **Fill** section of the right panel with a layer selected.
2. Click on the color swatch in the **Fill** section to open up the color picker.
3. In the top bar of the color picker, click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="image_fill" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/UaEWmyqIP0iiZAIkJTe_pQ.svg" width="20" />.
4. Select an image from on your computer and click **Open**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_image_fill.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_image_fill.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Use the drop-down list below the **Choose image** button to select the fill method:

- **Fill**. Adjusts the image size to the layer’s width.
- **Fit**. Adjusts the image size to fit the layer’s height.
- **Stretch**. Stretches the image to fit the layer’s width and height.
- **Tile**. Duplicates the image in a tile pattern to fit the layer. The size of tiles is adjustable.

## Replacing images

There are two ways you can replace images. 

The first is to select an image and click the **Replace image** button in the **Image** section in the right panel. This only works for images [added directly to the canvas](#adding-images-to-the-canvas).

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="replace_image" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/--lPgBgoE0KJitXct9sAvw.svg" width="844" /> 

To **replace an image fill**, select the layer with the fill, click the swatch in the **Fill** section, then **Choose image**.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use these methods when you need to replace your current image with an image from the internet. Just paste the URL of the new image into the <b>File name</b> field of the <b>Open</b> dialog box and click <b>Open</b>.</p>
</div>

Another quick way to **replace an image or image fill** is by holding down `Ctrl` / `⌘` and drag-and-dropping an image from your desktop or the **Photos** library onto a layer, like in the demo below.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/images_crop.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/images_crop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Image upscaler

Whenever you need to enhance the resolution and quality of an image, use the AI-powered <a href="https://icons8.com/upscaler" target="_blank">Icons8 Image Upscaler</a> built into Lunacy.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="upscaler" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/9f14tl6R60ygAU8MH16xoA.svg" width="844" /> 

When you add an image to your document, the **Upscale image** prompt appears above it. Click it and wait a few seconds as the Upscaler enhances the image.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/images_crop.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/images_crop.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The feature only is available to users with any paid subscription to Icons8 graphic assets.</p>
</div>

### Background remover

To **remove a background** from an image:

1. Select the image.
2. In the right panel, click **Remove background**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/images_background_remover.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/images_background_remover.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


### Cutting out a part of an image

You can cut out part of an image so it becomes a new image layer that you can adjust as you like.

To **cut out a part of an image**:

1. Select the image.
2. Press `Enter` to enable **Edit mode**.
3. Choose one of the selection tools that show up below the image:
    - **Scissors**. With scissors, you can make a selection with any shape (rectangle, ellipse, triangle, etc.) by selecting the shape on the toolbar or pressing the corresponding shape shortcut.
    - **Freeform lasso**. With the freeform lasso, draw freehand selections on parts of the image, just like with the Pencil tool. To close the selection border, just release the mouse button.
    - **Polygon lasso**. Use the polygonal lasso to make selections using paths, similar to using the Pen tool. To disable snapping while drawing the selection, hold down `Ctrl` / `⌘`.
4. Once you have an area selected:
    - Press `Delete` to remove it completely.
    - Move the selection to where you want it to be. In this case, Lunacy creates a vector shape with an image fill that corresponds to your selection and automatically fills the emptied area with the color that’s prevalent along the selection border.

Change the hue, saturation, contrast, and other properties of your images.

To do this:

1. Select one or several image layers.
2. Click `+` next to **Image filters** in the right panel.
3. Drag the sliders to adjust the image.

Learn how to work with different types of layers in Lunacy

A **layer** is any element you see on the canvas.

There are several types of layers in Lunacy:
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#frames" target="_blank">Frames</a>
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/" target="_blank">Text layers</a>
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#pen-tool" target="_blank">Vectors</a>
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#shape-tools" target="_blank">Shapes</a>
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#image-tool" target="_blank">Images</a>
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/" target="_blank">Components and component instances</a>
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#icon-tool" target="_blank">Icons</a> 
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#hotspot-tool" target="_blank">Hotspots</a> 
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#slice-tool" target="_blank">Slices</a> 

Follow the links above to learn how to work with specific layers in detail. In this section, we’ll go over the basics: how to create, edit, and organize layers on the canvas and the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#layer-list" target="_blank">Layer list</a>.

## Adding layers

**Add layers** to the canvas using the corresponding tools on the toolbar:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="lunacy_toolbar Copy" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/on88vuNDlEGTTKZXKd1qTA.svg" width="844" /> 

For most of the tools (except for the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#select-tool" target="_blank">Select</a>, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#hand-tool" target="_blank">Hand</a>, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#eyedropper-tool" target="_blank">Eyedropper</a>, and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#comment-tool" target="_blank">Comment</a> tools), all you need to do is:

1. Enable them (use shortcuts for a faster workflow). 
2. **Click** or **click and drag** on the canvas to add the respective layer. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_tools_demo.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_tools_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Note the different icons these layers have before their titles in the Layer list.

### [Layer properties](#layer-properties)

The properties displayed in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#the-right-panel" target="_blank">right panel</a> when a layer is selected depend on the type of layer. The ones listed below are universal for almost all layer types:

| Right panel properties &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description |   
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="alignment" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/DmwgUeA720CJZI1lz-PJ9w.svg" width="500" />  | **Alignment and distribution controls** appear when you select two or more layers. |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="layer_position_size" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/s3beB96toEGEkauAALbBGA.svg" width="500" />  |  **Layer size and position.** Change the size of your layers and their position on the canvas.

Use the two buttons on the right to adjust the radius of individual corners and to enable smooth corner radius like in iOS interfaces. |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="component" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/kv1070nxoEG0xJn6p3EqCQ.svg" width="500" /> |   **Component options.** Use this section to manage <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/">components</a>. Create new component states, switch between them, and detach instances from main components.  |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="style_section" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/M7sKosLblUis17slSInjjg.svg" width="500" />     |   The   **Style** section displays the styles applied to your layer (text styles, color styles, effect styles, etc.)  You can add styles from <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/#ui-kits">UI kits</a>, create your own, and detach layers from applied styles. |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="opacity_blend" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/jU4eHkw6H0aRu54WtjdtlQ.svg" width="500" />   |   **Opacity and blend mode settings.** Set the overall opacity of a layer and its blending mode.   |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="fills" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/fIXEmqXID02zbOWgEcQtOA.svg" width="500" />   |   **Fills.**  Change the color of your layer.  |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="borders" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/hCg84E6xQ02xJxqoFK17hg.svg" width="500" />   |   **Borders.**  Add borders to your layers. |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="effects" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/UmOMNRV4XESuD2JDMXvi6Q.svg" width="500" />   |     **Effects.**  Add effects (shadows, blurs) to your layers. |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="prototyping" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/NJc1I6eaxk21Auc91YH7XA.svg" width="500" />   |   **Prototyping.**   Activate prototyping options and turn your static designs into interactive prototypes. Here's <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/prototyping/" target="_blank">how it works</a>. |
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="selection_properties" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/-zycpFIau0603lT5epFZFQ.svg" width="500" />  |     **Selection properties.**  Shows the colors and fonts used in selected layers. |

### Locking and hiding layers

**Lock layers** to protect them from accidental edits using the `Ctrl + Shift + L` / `⌘ + Shift + L` shortcuts.

To **hide a layer** from the canvas, press `Ctrl + Shift + H` / `⌘ + Shift + H`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_lock_hide.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_lock_hide.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## [Frames](#frames)

**Frames** are special types of layers that work like containers for your designs.

Using frames is optional, but they come in handy when you’re designing for a specific screen size or device, and they are a must for <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/prototyping/" target="_blank">prototyping</a>. 

This is how frames appear in the **Layer list**:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="frames_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/2DFQ_UkoJE-xNA5RZ63EXA.svg" width=844 /> 

### Adding frames

To **create a frame**:

1. Press `A` or select the **Frame tool** on the toolbar.
2. **Click and drag** to add a custom frame or **choose a preset** from the right panel. The list features presets for popular devices, screen resolutions, and social media templates.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you're creating a frame on the canvas, blue <code>+</code> signs will appear around the borders, indicating pre-existing presets. Drag the corner of the frame you're creating to a <code>+</code> to snap it to a preset (the name of the preset will appear in the Layer list). To hide the + signs, hold down <code>Ctrl</code> / <code>⌘</code>.</p>
</div>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_adding_frames.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_adding_frames.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can place layers inside frames by:

- Selecting one or several layers and pressing `Ctrl + Alt + G` / `⌘ + ⌥ + G`.
- Drawing a frame over them.

To **remove a frame**, use the ungroup shortcut: `Ctrl + Shift + G` / `⌘ + Shift + G`.

Check out the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/shortcuts/" target="_blank">full list of handy Lunacy shortcuts</a>.

#### Custom presets

You can also a **add custom presets** to this list:

1. Select the custom frame.
2. Click the **Create Frame Preset** button in the Preset size and orientation section.
3. Name the preset and press `Enter`.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="custom_frame" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/oSB3aZSbokmkFORi-TWUtw.svg" width=844 />

From now on, the custom frame preset will appear at the bottom of the preset list in the right panel.

### Frame properties

Right panel properties for frames are more or less identical to [layer properties](#layer-properties), except frames don’t have Style and Prototyping options.

They also have these additional properties:

| Right panel properties | Description |   
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="frame_preset_size" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/AQrMrq0BdkG833S3rs16TQ.svg" width="500" />  |  **Frame preset, size, and position.** The same options as for layers. You can also change your frame size preset.  |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="clip_content" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/jz6OnY46_Uy-ATZtsevRLA.svg" width="500" />  |     **Clip content.**  Select this checkbox to hide content outside of the frame boundaries. |
|   <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="autolayout" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/VVkJQG7mZESrsh2vQBoruA.svg" width="500" />   |   **Auto layout.**  A set of parameters for configuring <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/autolayout/" target="_blank">auto layouts</a>. |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="frame_color_adjust" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/ZWhmOvSgV0Wn2tLg80A-Ug.svg" width="500" />    |     **Background color.** Change the frame color. |
|  <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="layout_grid" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/9-2Cn2UMuU-1oe_XPYabqQ.svg" width="500" /> |     **Layout grid.**  Add a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#layout-grid" target="_blank">layout grid</a> to the frame.|
| <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="square_grid" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/15ZcB9kEdkmu1y7FAZHefQ.svg" width="500" />  |     **Grid.**  Add a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#square-grid" target="_blank">square grid</a> to the frame. |


## [Working with layers](#working-with-layers)

This section covers basic operations with layers, including [selecting](#selecting-layers), [grouping](#grouping-layers), [duplicating](#duplicating-layers), [arranging](#arranging-layers), [moving](#moving-layers), and [resizing](#resizing-layers) layers.

### [Selecting layers](#selecting-layers)

You can **select layers** in the **Layer list** or directly on the canvas.

To **select a layer on the canvas**, click on it when the **Select tool** (`V`) is active. Hold `Shift` to select several layers. You can also drag to create a selection around one or several layers.

Clicking on a [group of layers](#grouping-layers) selects the entire group. To select individual layers inside it, hold down `Ctrl` / `⌘` as you click, or first click to select the group, then double click to select the layer. Read more about [groups](#grouping-layers) below. 

To **select all layers** on the canvas (except for locked layers), press `Ctrl + A` / `⌘ + A`.

To **select a layer in the Layer list**, find it in the list and click on it.

Hold down `Shift` or `Ctrl` / `⌘` to **select multiple layers**.

**See also:**
<br>
<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#select-tool" target="_blank">Select tool</a>

#### [Selection fonts and colors](#selection-fonts-and-colors)

When you select two or more layers, the right panel displays all of the **fonts and colors** used in those layers in the right panel. This way, you can quickly switch fonts and colors for several layers at a time.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="selection_fonts_colors" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/SOMTdAZ_10CZcQAHxB9snA.svg" width="844" /> 

Click the target icon (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Vector 2" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/oXeqn7keHUWVaWWBnC9dyg.svg" width="16" />) next to a property to select just the layers using this color/font.

### [Grouping layers](#grouping-layers)

You can combine multiple layers together in a **group**. You can then modify the group and resize it along with the elements it contains.

[Frames](#frames) are more versatile, but groups are also a great way to organize the **Layer list**, which can include hundreds of items or more in some projects. You can **nest groups** in other groups or inside frames in whatever way is most convenient to you.

To **create a group**, select two or more layers and press `Ctrl + G` / `⌘ + G` or click the **Group** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="group_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/5r_SYxtNb0W0vCtkeKg73w.svg" width="16"/>) on the **context toolbar** at the top of the canvas.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_grouping.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_grouping.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To **select a layer inside** a group:

- Hold down the `Ctrl` key and click the required layer.

    OR

- Click to select the group, then double click to select the layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_grouping_selecting.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_grouping_selecting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

After you select a layer within a group, you can switch to other layers of that group simply by clicking them. 

If needed, you can also enable the **Select group's content on click** option in the right panel, so a click over a group automatically selects the layers inside it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_select_content_on_click.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_select_content_on_click.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Alternatively, you can select layers inside groups through the **Layer list**, which may be more convenient in some cases (for example, when handling fully overlapping layers).

You can **move layers into or out of a group** by dragging them in the Layer list.

To **ungroup layers**, select the group and press `Ctrl + Shift + G` / `⌘ + Shift + G` or click the Ungroup (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="ungroup_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/AGCFPZ8tpUeYoHbgEWlT_Q.svg" width="16" />) button on the **context toolbar**.

### [Duplicating layers](#duplicating-layers)

To **duplicate a layer**:

- Select it and press `Ctrl + D` / `⌘ + D`.
    
    OR

- Hold down `Alt`, select the layer, and drag to where you want to place the copy.


You can also use the standard `Ctrl` / `⌘` + `C` / `V` shortcuts, but in this case, the layer copies will appear right on top of the original.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_copying_duplicating.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_copying_duplicating.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Lunacy remembers the offset of the latest duplicate. So, if you press <code>Ctrl + D</code> / <code>⌘ + D</code> shortly after you create a duplicate of a layer, Lunacy adds new duplicates with the same offset as the previous one.</p>
</div>

If copied layers include generated content, like <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#avatar-tool" target="_blank">avatars</a> or <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#text-generation" target="_blank">generated texts</a>, duplicates will appear with new content (provided the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#auto-refresh" target="_blank">Auto refresh</a> option is enabled).

#### Repeat grid

Another convenient way to duplicate elements is to use the **Repeat grid** feature. You select two or more layers, drag the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="repeat_grid" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/arkPFiXr3U-oF3BIzB96uQ.svg" width="20" /> near the lower-right corner of the bounding box to duplicate the elements in a grid.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_repeat_grid_demo.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_repeat_grid_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Combining **Repeat grid** with the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#avatar-tool" target="_blank">Avatar tool</a> and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#text-generation" target="_blank">generated texts</a> can save you a lot of time when designing UIs with placeholder elements.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_repeat_grid.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_repeat_grid.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Copy/Paste style

You can quickly **copy and paste styling properties** (fills, borders, effects) between layers. 

To **copy the properties of a layer**:

1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + C` / `⌘ + ⌥ + C`. 
2. Select another layer and press `Ctrl + Alt + V` / `⌘ + ⌥ + V`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_copy_pasting_style.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_copy_pasting_style.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Copy/paste context menu options

Various copy/paste options are also available on the context menu:

| Menu option    | Shortcut           |  Description |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Copy    | `Ctrl + C` / `⌘ + C`| Copies the selected layer.|
| Cut     | `Ctrl + X` / `⌘ + X`| Cuts the selected layer and copies it to the clipboard.      |
| Paste   | `Ctrl + V` / `⌘ + V`| Pastes the content of the clipboard onto the canvas.  |
| Paste here     |   - | Pastes the content of the clipboard onto the canvas, depending on where the cursor is.   |
| Paste over     | - | Pastes the content of the clipboard over the selected layer. |
| Copy as Text   | - | Only available for text layers. Copies only the text content of the layer, excluding its properties.   |
| Copy as CSS/SVG/XAML/PNG     | - | These options allow you to copy the code of the selected layer in the required format.   |
| Copy style/Paste style| `Ctrl + Alt + C` / `⌘ + ⌥ + C`<br><br>`Ctrl + Alt + V` / `⌘ + ⌥ + V`     |  These options allow you to copy the style of the selected layer and apply them to another layer. |  
| Export as PNG to cloud, Copy URL    | `Alt + C` / `⌥ + C` | Exports the selection to the Icons8 cloud and copies the link to your clipboard. You can share the link to your design with other people. |

### [Arranging layers](#arranging-layers)

#### Auto Z-index

Lunacy automatically determines the order of layers (the Z-index) on the canvas depending on their size. For example, if you drag a smaller layer (that’s at the bottom of the layer list) over a larger one, Lunacy places the small layer on top.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_auto_z_index.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_auto_z_index.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can **adjust layer order manually** in the **Layer list** and also use shortcuts or context menu commands:

| Context menu command | Description    | Windows/Linux shortcut  | MacOS shortcut  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------|
| Bring forward   | Moves the selected layer one step forward.| `Ctrl + ]`   |  `⌘ + ]`    |
| Bring to front  | Places the selected layer at the top of the stack, above all other elements. | `Ctrl + Shift + ]`  | `⌘ + Shift + ]` |
| Send backward   | Moves the selected layer one step backward.    | `Ctrl + [`   |  `⌘ + [`    |
| Send to back    | Places the selected layer to the bottom of the stack.    | `Ctrl + Shift + [` | `⌘ + Shift + [` |

#### Aligning and distributing layers

To quickly align and distribute layers on the canvas, use the Align and Distribute spacing controls in the top row of the right panel.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="alignment_controls" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/_OCR-ofHFkeTMk_2FFX7kw.svg" width="844" /> 

They become active when you select two or more layers on the canvas or when you select a single layer on a frame (in this case, Lunacy will align the layer relative to the borders of the frame).

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_alignment_controls.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_alignment_controls.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

| Icon | Description     | Windows/Linux shortcut  | MacOS shortcut  |

The layers at the right and left borders of the selection always preserve their original position, while the layers between them adjust their positions so that the spacing between all elements is equal. | `Ctrl + Shift + H`     | `⌘ + Shift + H` |

##### Smart distribute

Use **Smart distribute** to arrange multiple layers into grids with equal spacing between rows and columns. The **Tidy up** button becomes active when you select two or more layers on the canvas and either looks like three straight lines (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Tidy_up_1" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/o2MZGYTQkkaYQTF987Kiig.svg" width="16" />) or a grid (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Tidy_up_2" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/kah22MhN2EqajOQ4ebdYiQ.svg" width="16" />) icon:   


<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="tidy_up_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/dUQwjuRvAEK7D68xLK4Csg.svg" width="844" /> 

To use **Smart distribute**:

1. Select the required layers.
2. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Vector 2" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/K-hAbTZwSU-b8Xh8WIzrgw.svg" width="16" /> / <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Vector 3" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/BvNKlqbncUWbW0Nlg_ZcGQ.svg" width="16" />
3. Once the layers get organized, pink controls appear in the middle of the layers and between them. Click and drag them to rearrange the layers or adjust the spacing between them.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_smart_distribute.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_smart_distribute.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        
#### Creating hyperlinks between layers

You can **create hyperlinks** from one layer to another in your document, even if the layers are on different pages. his can be useful, for example, for simplifying navigation in large documents.

To do this:

1. Select the target layer and press `Ctrl + L` / `⌘ + L` (or select **Copy/Paste as → Copy link** on the context menu).
2. Select the layer that should lead to the target layer.
3. Press `F2` to rename the layer, paste the target layer link from your clipboard, and press `Enter`.
4. Hold down `Ctrl` / `⌘` and click the layer you renamed, and you’ll be redirected to the target layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_hyperlinks.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_hyperlinks.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### [Moving layers](#moving-layers)

To **move a layer**, just click and drag it.

If you want to **restrict layer movement to the X or Y axis**, hold down `Shift` while you’re moving the layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_moving.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_moving.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

For precise positioning, use the arrow keys. Each keystroke moves a layer by one pixel. Holding down `Shift` increases each step to 10px.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_move_arrow_keys.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_move_arrow_keys.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also adjust a layer’s position on the canvas or frame using the **X and Y controls in the right panel**:

- If a layer is on the canvas, the values in the X and Y fields show the absolute coordinates of its top-left selection handle.
- If a layer is a part of a frame, X and Y display the coordinates of its top-left selection handle relative to the frame’s top-left corner.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_moving_right_panel.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_moving_right_panel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Measuring distances between layers can also help with positioning them more accurately. Simply select a layer, press <code>Alt</code> / <code>⌥</code>, and hover the cursor over another layer to measure the distance between them. Read about all <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#measuring-distances" target="_blank">measurement options</a> in Lunacy in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/" target="_blank">Basics</a> page.</p>

#### Rotating layers

To **rotate a layer**, select it, then:

- Hover the cursor somewhere any corner of the bounding box. The cursor will turn into a bent double-headed arrow, which you can drag left or right.

    OR

- Change the value in the rotation angle field in the right panel and press `Enter`.

To quickly return the layer into its initial position, type `0` in the angle rotation field of the right panel and press `Enter`. You can also hold down `Shift` when rotating the layer to rotate at 90° or 45° angles to quickly get it to its original orientation.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_rotating_resetting.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_rotating_resetting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Flipping layers

To flip a layer, use the **Flip horizontally** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="flip_horizontal" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/_zeiHNxlRkGVVIfMvHuRGw.svg" width="16" />) and **Flip vertically** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="flip_vertical" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/W2egL4YoiEqEbxKd7Psy7A.svg" width="16" />) buttons that appear on the context toolbar (also available in the **Layer** section on the menu bar).

You can also use these shortcuts:

- `Ctrl + →` and `Ctrl + ←` / `⌘ + →` and `⌘ + ←` — horizontal flip
- `Ctrl + ↑` and `Ctrl + ↓` / `⌘ + ↑` and `⌘ + ↓` — vertical flip

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_flipping_buttons_shortcuts.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_flipping_buttons_shortcuts.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Another way to flip a layer is to drag selection handles like in the demo below.
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_flipping_handles.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_flipping_handles.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### [Resizing layers](#resizing-layers)

There are several ways to resize a layer:

- [Dragging its selection handles](#resizing-by-dragging-selection-handles)
- [Using arrow keys](#resizing-using-arrow-keys)
- [Changing right panel properties](#resizing-by-adjusting-right-panel-properties)
- [With the Scale tool](#scaling-layers)

#### [Resizing by dragging selection handles](#resizing-by-dragging-selection-handles)

To **resize a layer**, drag any of its selection handles at the corners to adjust its height and width or drag the sides of the bounding box to resize a layer vertically or horizontally.

Hold down `Shift` while dragging to preserve the layer’s aspect ratio. Also, you can hold down `Alt` / `⌥` while dragging to **resize the layer from the center**, rather than from the edge you are dragging.

The `Alt + Shift + drag` / `⌥ + Shift + drag` shortcut resizes a layer from the center *and* preserves its aspect ratio.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_resizing.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_resizing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When resizing a frame, its content adjusts to fit the new size. If you want to resize only the frame and keep its content intact, hold down `Ctrl`/`⌘` while resizing.

#### [Resizing using arrow keys](#resizing-using-arrow-keys)

Select the layer and use the shortcuts `Ctrl + arrow keys` / `⌘ + arrow keys` to resize by 1px or `Ctrl + Shift + arrow keys` / `⌘ + Shift + arrow keys` to resize by 10px.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_resizing_arrow_keys.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_resizing_arrow_keys.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### [Resizing by adjusting right panel properties](#resizing-by-adjusting-right-panel-properties)

Select a layer and change the values in the the **W (width)** and **H (height)** fields in the right panel to precisely define its size.

Click the **Lock aspect ratio** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="lock_aspect_ratio" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/4GvxWU5LIUGH6eaZaP3Vpw.svg" width ="16" />) to preserve the layer’s aspect ratio.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_resizing_right_panel.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_resizing_right_panel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### [Scaling layers](#scaling-layers)

Use the **Scale tool** to resize a layer while preserving the aspect ratio and adjusting the size of any borders/effects applied to the layer.

To **scale a layer**:
1. Select the layer.
2. Press `K` or select the **Scale tool** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="scale_tool" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/scm-lgqtykigv546NkSUrQ.svg" width="16" />) on the toolbar.
3. Drag the bounding box to resize it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_scaling.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_scaling.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When the **Scale tool** is selected, changing layer size values in the right panel will also scale the layer and all its effects proportionally.

#### Resizing constraints

With **resizing constraints**, you can determine the behavior of a layer when resizing a group, component, or frame containing the layer. This can be very useful when you need to design a user interface for different screen sizes or devices.

You can adjust the individual resizing behavior for each layer in the **Constraints** section of the **right panel**:
- The **Pin to edge** control, which pins the layer to one or several edges of the group/component/frame. So, when you resize the container, Lunacy won’t change the distance between the layer and the edges it is pinned to.
- The **Fix width** and **Fix size** checkboxes restrict the change of the layer’s width or height so they don’t change as you resize the layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/layers_resizing_constraints.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/layers_resizing_constraints.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Resizing constraints aren’t available for layers in an auto layout frame unless the layer has an absolute position.</p>

# Layer and text styles
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/layerstyles.md

Learn how to speed up your work with layer and text styles

Layer and text styles are sets of predefined properties (fills, borders, effects) that you can use to speed up your design workflow and ensure a consistent look throughout your projects. When you update a style, all associated layers automatically reflect the changes.

The only difference between layer and text styles is that the latter also include typography properties like font, size, line spacing, etc.

You can manage and organize styles in the **Styles** tab.

### Creating styles

There are two ways of creating styles.

**Way 1.** Select a layer with the properties you're likely to reuse and save them as a style.

**Way 2.** Click `+` in the **Styles** list and define all the required properties.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/creating_styles_ph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/creating_styles.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Applying styles

Select the required layer or several layers, then choose the style you want to apply from the right panel.

Optionally, you can apply styles using the left panel (watch the video above).

### Modifying a layer style

There are two ways to modify a style.

**Way 1.**

1. Switch to the **Styles** tab, then click the style you want to modify
2. In the displayed panel, make the required changes.
3. Close the panel to apply changes.

**Way 2.**

1. Select a layer using the style you want to modify.
2. Make the required changes in the right panel. When you are done, you will see an asterisk (*) next to the style name in the right panel. It indicates that changes have been made to the style.

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="editing_style" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/14zxECrRDUSbcciXXjl2PQ.svg" /> 


3. Use one of the following options:

    * **Update Style** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Checkmark" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/lQA_atI7Bk-0aprvMzlB5w.svg" />): Saves the changes to the existing style.
    * **Create New Layer Style** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Plus" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/_rTigJIyfUmibMI3iRNl5Q.svg" />): Saves the changes to a new style.
    * **Reset Style** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Reset" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/-CkP9OjHL0Kz5Vxza54Eig.svg" />) : Discards all changes that you have made.


### Detaching a style

Select the required layer and click the **Detach style** button shown below.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="detaching_style" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/9IaLOhrj3kaLEqqUJV4FKw.svg" /> 


The appearance of the layer remains the same, but it is no longer associated with the style and further changes to the style will not affect the layer.

### Organizing styles

It is a good practice to organize styles into groups similar to those shown in the figure below.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="organizing_styles" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/H7X3965HHUWrgLYs26FQLA.svg" /> 


To organize your styles into groups, consider the following format of style names:

`Group name / Subgroup name / Style name`  

For example, to organize your styles of backgrounds, you can give them the following names:

* Backgrounds / Light
* Backgrounds / Dark
* etc.

The number of nesting levels for subgroups is not limited.

Another way of organizing styles:

1. Holding down `Shift`, select styles in the left panel.
2. Right-click.
3. On the context menu, click **Group**.
4. Rename the group to the desired name.  

To rename a style or a style group:

1. Double-click over the style/group.
2. Type the new name and press `Enter`.

Style groups and styles appear in the A-Z order in the left panel.

### Duplicating styles

You can duplicate your existing styles and quickly create new ones based on their parents.

To duplicate a style:

* Click the style in the list and press `Ctrl + D`.

    OR
* Right-click the style in the list and select **Duplicate** on the displayed menu.

Also, you can select and duplicate several styles at a time.

### Copying styles between documents

To copy styles between documents:

1. Select one or several styles in the source document (hold down `Ctrl` or `Shift` to select multiple items).
2. Right-click and select **Copy style** on the displayed menu.
3. Switch to the target document.
4. Open the **Styles** tab.
5. Right-click over the left panel and select **Paste style** on the displayed menu.

# Built-in graphics
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/libraries.md

How to make use of our built-in icons, photos, images and UI kits

One of the cool things in Lunacy is Libraries. Libraries are collections of visual elements that you can add onto your designs in no time. These collections are accessible through the content tabs and include the following:

* [Icons](#icons)
* [Photos](#photos-and-masked-photos)
* [Illustrations](#illustrations)
* [UI kits](#ui-kits)

![A view of the Libraries tabs](public/libraries61.png)

For your convenience, the items inside libraries (icons and vector illustrations) are organized by styles categories. Also, to find the required item, you can use the search field at the top of the left panel. Once you've found the item you like, just click it and drag onto the canvas. That's it!

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/libraries-addingiconsph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/libraries-addingicons.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


Now you can work with the item in the same way as with any other similar layers.

With some limitations you can use all the library items for free. Speaking in plain words, if you are using our app and content for free, please be honest. Your designs *must* include a link to the <a href="https://icons8.com" target="_blank">Icons8 website</a>, otherwise our lawyers get nervous and unhappy.

To be able to edit photos in high resolution or to convert icons and illustrations to vector you should subscribe to one of our <a href="https://icons8.com/pricing" target="_blank">paid plans</a>.

The sections below describe library-specific actions that you can perform with library items.

## [Icons](#icons)

The Lunacy icon library includes tons of icons in different styles. After installation your app will feature only free-to-use icons. To have the full library at hand, you should download it.

![Downloading icons library](public/dnldicn.png)


## [Photos and masked photos](#photos-and-masked-photos)

When working with the photo libraries you can make use of such handy features as:

* Image replacement
* Searching for similar images

To **replace** an image on the canvas, drag an image from the library and hover it somewhere near the center of the current image. Wait a moment until the green mask and replacement icon appear, and then release the mouse button.

![Replacing an image](public/replaceimage.gif)

To **search** the library for images similar to the one you have on the canvas, right-click the image and select **Find similar** on the displayed menu.

![Searching for a similar image](public/findsimilar.png)

Lunacy will run through its photo library and display the best matches on the library panel.

## [Illustrations](#illustrations)

Illustrations is a collection of vector images for awesome web, mobile and UI designs. But if you are on a free plan, you will only be able to use library items as rasters.

![Illustrations library](public/illustrations1.png)

Like with [photos](#photos-and-masked-photos), when working with illustrations you can use the **replacement** and **find similar** features.



# Linked design
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/linked_design.md

How to update live webpages directly from Lunacy

With the **Linked design** feature, you can adjust your designs in Lunacy and apply the changes to a webpage without leaving the app. This works with changes to:

* Vector content
* Text and raster content
* Colors
* Styling effects (borders, shadows, etc.)
* Layer shapes
* Layer sizes

<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is only available in <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/clouddocs/" target="_blank">cloud documents</a>.</p>
</div>

To learn more about the pros of linked design and potential use cases, check out <a href="https://blog.icons8.com/articles/editing-live-web-pages-from-a-graphic-app-is-no-longer-a-dream/" target="_blank">this article</a>. 


## How it works for a web developer

Switching to linked design might slightly impact your standard practices in the beginning, but it saves you lots of time in the long run.

Here's how it works:

1. Deselect all layers (press `Esc` or click anywhere over the canvas).
2. Open the **Export** tab in the right panel.
3. Copy the code with the link to the CSS file and paste it to the **head** section of your HTML code.

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="svg 3" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/xua3QlhLPUCPfH7csI-EmQ.svg" width ="844" />  

    Later on, stick to the CSS styles and color variables from this file in your code. To see the CSS code generated by Lunacy, open the link to the CSS file in your browser.

4. In the same panel, copy the code with the script for fetching text content and paste it under the **body** section of your HTML code.

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="svg 4" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/G4hZZlbw9ECC99AdzUDBxA.svg" width ="844" /> 

5. One by one, select the layers/layer groups subject to updates from Lunacy, copy their embed code from the **Export** panel and paste it to your HTML code. The advantage of embeds is that they load SVG content into the DOM, and you can apply JavaScript to any embedded element. 

Here's a visual explanation of the process:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0X-TeBtPDs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## How it works for a designer

#### The basics

To make sure that your linked designs work properly, keep these things in mind:

* The use of <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/" target="_blank">text styles</a> is a **must**.
* Any raster images you update via linked design **must** belong to layer groups. You can put all your raster images into a single group or combine them with vector layers in a more logical way, just remember: **standalone image layers won't be updated**. If you're not going to update an image, you can leave it ungrouped.
* **Do not** rename layer and text styles after a linked design is online. These names are used in the CSS code, so if you modify them, you'll break the links with the current code.
* For the same reason, **do not** add new styles if you don't want to bother the web developer team. Edit your current styles instead.

#### Applying changes

Here's how you can apply changes to a live webpage:

**For non-text layers:**

1. Select the altered layer/layer group.
2. Open the **Export** tab in the right panel.
3. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > next to the **Linked design** section. This will apply the changes to the webpage.

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="svg 5 Copy" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/ACYsQrDtUkSZyKE0lL3AtA.svg" width ="844" /> 
    
    
    <div class="callout callout--info">
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > button appears disabled, click the question mark next to it first.</p>
    </div>

4. Do this for all the elements you need to upload.

**For text layers:**

1. When you're done editing all of your text layers, deselect all layers on the canvas (press `Esc` or click anywhere over the canvas).
2. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > next to the **Linked design** section. This will apply the changes to the webpage.

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="svg 7" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/tdocmRnNoEKC5rox84tqvw.svg" />

    <div class="callout callout--info">
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > button appears disabled, click the question mark next to it first.</p>

# Private Cloud
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/private_cloud.md

How to collaborate in total privacy

Many industries feel uneasy knowing that their data is floating somewhere in the clouds without proper control — banking, healthcare, insurance, you name it.

For design teams working in such fields, Lunacy offers a **Private Cloud** solution with two deployment options: **on-premises** and **virtual private server (VPS)**.

## Private cloud on-premises

For companies with a strong focus on security who prefer to keep all their data in-house. 

**How it works**

- You deploy your personal Lunacy Cloud on a dedicated server within your corporate network.
- You configure the teams and control who can edit or view certain documents.
- You take full care of the server and backups.
- Your administrator installs the updates after all the required checks.

**What you get**

- Total control over your design cloud.
- Happy design and other teams enjoying the perks that cloud collaboration brings.
- Happy security department since no data gets outside.


## Private cloud on VPS

This option is for the teams that don’t feel like sharing a common cloud with the rest of the world but aren’t quite ready to manage their own servers. 

**How it works**

- Our engineers deploy, configure, and update Lunacy Private Cloud for you on a virtual private server in any region or jurisdiction.
- You configure the teams and control who can edit or view certain documents.
- You make backups of your documents or delegate it to our engineers.
- Our engineers assist you with any technical matters as needed.
- Unlike users of privately hosted clouds, you can keep using built-in graphics and Lunacy’s AI tools.

**What you get**

To create a prototype, you typically need three key elements:  

- **Hotspot** – an interactive zone that triggers an action. It can be an entire frame or a specific element within a frame, like a button or menu option. You can turn any selected frame or element into a hotspot by pressing `H` or clicking `+` in the Prototyping section of the right panel.  

  You can also create dedicated hotspot layers, which are useful when an element is too small to interact with comfortably. By adding a hotspot layer over it, you can enlarge the clickable area. To do this, select the **Hotspot tool** from the toolbar (or press `H` when nothing is selected) and draw the hotspot layer wherever needed.  

- **Connection** – a visual arrow that links the hotspot to its destination, defining the flow of the interaction.  

- **Destination** – the target frame or a specific location within a frame where the interaction will take the user.  


The video below shows an example of creating a simple prototype.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/prototyping_linking_frames.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/simpleprototypev11.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

What happens in the video:  

1. We select **Frame 1**, click `+` in the **Prototyping** section, and link it to **Frame 2**. This makes the entire frame interactive—clicking anywhere on it (default action) navigates to Frame 2.  
2. In **Frame 2**, we create a **hotspot** over the icon and text block, grouping them into a single interactive zone. We then link this hotspot back to **Frame 1**.  
3. Pressing `F5` opens the **prototype player**. Clicking anywhere in Frame 1 takes us to Frame 2. If we click outside the interactive zone in Frame 2, the player highlights the clickable area.  
4. Pressing `Esc` exits the prototype player.  

The **Prototyping** section offers various settings to help you design more complex prototypes with diverse animations, transitions, and interaction flows.

## Prototyping settings

When setting up an interaction in your prototype, think of it as answering a few key questions:

* **On what event?** (Trigger)
* **What happens?** (Action)
* **If it moves, where to?** (Destination)
* **What does it look like?** (Animation)
* **What happens if it is scrolled?** (Behavior on scroll)


The figure below explains the prototyping settings. Experimenting with these options will bring your designs to life with natural interactions.

### Triggers

Triggers define what starts an interaction in your prototype.

| **Trigger**        | **What it does**                                    | **Example use case**                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **On click**      | Activates when the user clicks on an element.     | Toggle a dropdown menu when clicking a button. |
| **On drag**       | Triggers when an element is dragged.              | Swipe between frames.             |
| **While hovering** | Runs as long as the cursor stays over an element. | Change the color of a button when hovered. (You'll need to have a component with different states to switch between them)|
| **While pressing**| Active while the user holds down a click or key.  | Show an animation while pressing a button. |
| **Key**           | Responds to a specific keyboard input.            | Press "Esc" to close a popup window.       |
| **Mouse enter**   | Fires when the cursor moves over an element.      | Expand a sidebar when the cursor enters its area. |
| **Mouse leave**   | Fires when the cursor moves away from an element. | Collapse a sidebar when the cursor leaves it. |
| **Mouse up**      | Triggers when a pressed mouse button is released. | Releasing the mouse dismisses a pop-up window. |
| **Mouse down**    | Triggers when a mouse button is pressed.          | Pressing a card makes it pop out slightly. |
| **After delay**   | Runs automatically after a set time.              | Show a notification after a few seconds.   |

### Actions
The action determines what happens next in the prototype after a trigger.

| **Action type**    | **What it does**                              | **Example use case**                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Navigate to**   | Moves the user to another frame.          | Clicking a button takes the user to a different screen. |
| **Scroll to**     | Scrolls to a specific section within the same frame. | Clicking "Back to top" smoothly scrolls to the top of the page. |
| **Open URL**      | Opens an external link in a browser.       | Clicking a "Learn more" button takes the user to a website. |
| **Back**         | Returns to the previous screen. This action type requires no links.        | A "Back" button navigates to the last visited frame. |
| **Open overlay**  | Displays a floating layer over the current screen. | Tapping "Delete" opens a warning. |
| **Swap overlay**  | Replaces the current overlay with another one. | Switching between different steps of a multi-step form. |
| **Close overlay** | Hides the currently active overlay.       | Clicking "X" closes  a pop-up window. |


### Destinations

The destinations dropdown (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Icon 24" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/eADidnPOo0GeElwzqXhkFg.svg" />) lists all available frames in the document, including those on other pages. Keeping frame names clear and organized is a good practice, especially in large projects—it will save you time when selecting the right frame.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Hovering over a frame in the list will automatically zoom to it.</p>
</div>

### Animations

Animations define how transitions between frames happen, adding fluidity to interactions. Below is a breakdown of the available animation types and their configuration options.

| **Animation type**  | **What it does**                                       | **Example use case**                                    | **Adjustable settings** |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Instant**       | Changes the frame immediately, with no transition. | Best for quick jumps between screens without visual effects. | None |
| **Dissolve**      | Fades the current frame into the next one.         | Smooth transitions for modals, pop-ups, or scene changes. | - Effects  <br> - Duration |
| **Move In / Out** | Moves the new frame in or the old frame out from a specified direction. | Creating a slide-in menu or overlay effect. | - Effects  <br> - Direction  <br> - Duration |
| **Push**         | Shifts the current frame out while bringing in the new one from the same direction. | Mimicking page transitions in mobile apps. | - Effects  <br> - Direction  <br> - Duration |
| **Slide In / Out** | Slides a frame into or out of view without affecting other elements. | Great for sidebars, notifications, or contextual menus. | - Effects  <br> - Direction  <br> - Duration |

You can preview how an animation will look and feel by hovering over the preview pane in the prototyping settings.


#### Animation effects

You can choose between the following animation effects:  
- **Linear** – moves at a steady pace without acceleration.  
- **Ease In** – starts slow and gradually speeds up.  
- **Ease Out** – moves quickly at first, then slows down before stopping.  
- **Ease In and Out** – combines both effects: begins slowly, accelerates in the middle, and slows down again.
- **Gentle** – creates a smooth, gradual transition for a soft feel.  
- **Quick** – moves rapidly for a snappy, responsive effect.  
- **Slow** – prolongs the transition for a more relaxed motion.  
- **Bouncy** – adds a playful, spring-like motion to the animation.   
- **Custom** – opens the Bézier curve editor, allowing you to fine-tune the acceleration and deceleration of an animation.

### **Behavior on scroll**  

These options determine how an element behaves when users scroll the prototype:  

- **Scroll** – the element moves along with the rest of the content as users scroll.  
- **Fixed** – the element stays in place while the background scrolls (e.g., floating buttons, support chat bubbles).  
- **Sticky** – the element scrolls normally but becomes fixed once it reaches the top of the prototype.  
- **Keep Scroll Position** – selecting this checkbox, ensures the prototype maintains the current [scroll position](#scrollable-prototypes) when navigating between screens, preventing it from resetting to the top.  

### Scrollable prototypes

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Scrollable prototypes work only with frames based on <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#adding-frames" target="_blank">frame presets</a> (Full HD, iMac, iPhone, etc.).</p>
    <p>If the list of preset frames does not include a frame of the required size, you can <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#custom-presets" target="_blank">create a custom preset</a>.</p>
</div>

To **create a scrollable prototype**:

1. Create a frame using a preset.
2. Resize the frame vertically. Resized frames have the label **Resized** in the right panel:

    <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Rezsized frame" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/GOdSpBpfskmcQGujzSMcPA.svg" /> 

3. Fill the frame with content and link it with other frames.

Preview the prototype as usual and scroll down to test out the interface.

## Previewing prototypes

To **preview a prototype**, select the frame you want to start with and click the **Play** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Play" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/HD-TYiNcVEy5Npo_ePOa8w.svg" width="20" />) at the top right corner of the interface.

If you want to always preview your prototype from a certain frame:

1. Left-click over the frame.
2. On the context menu, select **Set as Start Point**.
3. Before running the prototype player, make sure that nothing is selected.

How to reuse components and styles from other files

In Lunacy, any **cloud file** that contains components and/or layer or text styles can become a library. You can reuse those components and/or styles across other **cloud files**. This will help you speed up your workflow and keep your designs consistent.

To connect a library to a file:

1. In the left panel click **Components** or **Styles**, then click ![library_icon](public/openbook.png).
2. In the displayed window, find the file that you're going to use as a library.
3. In the lower-left corner of the file preview, click **Add**. A list of components/styles from the file will appear in the panel.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Adding_library" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/tMw9ngY2BUC_UZpTbW4m5Q.svg" /> 



Now you can start using the library like any other <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/" target="_blank">components</a> or <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/" target="_blank">styles</a>.


To disconnect a library from a file:

1. In the left panel, click **Components** or **Styles**, then click ![library_icon](public/openbook.png).
2. In the displayed window, find the library file.
3. In the lower-left corner of the file preview, click **Remove**. The lists of components/styles will disappear.

Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/styling.md

Learn how to work with styling options in Lunacy

Use **styling options** to define the color and effects of a layer, including:

- **Fills and tints.** Choose from solid, gradient, or image fills and apply tints to customize the colors.
- **Borders.** Add them to your layers to create clear distinctions or define boundaries.
- **Shadows.** Experiment with outer and inner shadows to add depth and dimension to your elements.
- **Blurs.** Add Gaussian or background blurs to your layers.

These options appear in the right panel whenever you select layer. 

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="styling_options" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/B5lyWRr6i0CpxecjtRet_w.svg" width="844" /> 

You can apply them to all <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#introduction" target="_blank">types of layers</a>, except for <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#hotspot-tool" target="_blank">hotspots</a>, and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#slice-tool" target="_blank">slices</a>, though not all layers have all of the styling options available. For example, groups have [tints](#tints) instead of [fills](#fills), and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/#managing-instances" target="_blank">component instances</a> have both these options.

Save time by <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/" target="_blank">creating layer styles</a> for individual or multiple styling options. You can easily reuse them across different layers, keeping your designs consistent.

## Adding styling options

To **apply a fill, border, or any other styling option** to a layer:

1. Select a layer.
2. Click `+` next to the required styling section in the **right panel**.
3. Adjust the settings to define styling parameters for the layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_adding_fills_borders_effects.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_adding_fills_borders_effects.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Managing and deleting styling options

Each layer can have multiple styling options of the same type (except for blurs). For example, you can apply an image fill to a layer and a semi-transparent solid fill on top of it. Also, a layer can have several borders or shadows. Just click the `+` icon to add another styling setting.

To adjust a layer’s appearance, rearrange the order of the styling settings within each section.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_moving_fills.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_moving_fills.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can temporarily hide some of the settings by clicking <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="eye_hide" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/QgphXanfmEC4xSEHsd4zpQ.svg" width="24" />. To delete a styling setting, click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Delete" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/atwbWW7Xe0W7xOC5ILLNhQ.svg" width="16" />.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_hide_delete.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_hide_delete.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Applying styling options to multiple layers

To apply styling options to multiple layers, select them and click `+` next to any of the styling sections in the right panel.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="effects_to_multiple_layers" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/sPPKm0BlvkOi4bgdTX9PVw.svg" width="844" /> 

If you see **Click + to replace mixed content** in any of the styling sections in the right panel, it means that the selected layers already have different settings for this option. 

Click `+` to override the current settings and apply the same styling option to the selected layers.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_to_multiple_layers.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_to_multiple_layers.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## [Fills](#fills)

**Fills** define the color of a layer. Fill options are available in all styling sections (except for blurs) and define the color of the selected layer, borders, or shadows. 

There are several ways to change the fill color. You can:

- Open the color picker/slider by clicking the color swatch in the **Fill** section. 
- Use the **Eyedropper tool** (`I`) and click on a color you want to use for your layer.
- Pick a color variable or a preset color.
- Inside the color picker, type or paste the HEX, RGBA, HSB, or HLS value for a solid fill into the color code input field. 
- Enter the HEX value for solid fills manually into the color text box in the **Fill** section or the color picker.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The methods below work for solid fills or parts of a gradient. </p>

**Add color preset.** Use this button to add the currently selected color to **Global** or **Document** presets.

<!--

#### Color variables

With **color variables**, you can efficiently manage colors in your documents and instantly recolor all the layers using the same variable. You can use color variables for fills, borders, and shadows.

In the right panel, color variables appear as round color swatches, while regular fills, border and shadow colors appear as square swatches.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="regular_colors_and_variables" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/xetAMkTRekO9pykOhzt32g.svg" width="844" /> 

To **create a color variable**:

1. Select a layer.
2. Open up the color picker by clicking the color swatch in the right panel.
3. Choose a color.
4. Click **Create Color Variable**.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="create_color_variable" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/Dd0LiF8lzkOIx0qX7qof6w.svg" width="844" /> 

To **apply an existing color variable** to a layer:

1. Select a layer.
2. Open up the color dropdown menu.
3. Select the required color variable.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_applying_color_variable.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_applying_color_variable.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_edit_variable.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_edit_variable.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

With a layer selected, use one of these ways to **detach a layer from a color variable**:

- [Change its color](#fills).
- Click `+` in the right panel to add a new fill and delete the color variable fill.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_detach_variable.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_detach_variable.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Color palettes and auto shape colors

All newly created documents have a color palette which includes document color variables for main, accent, background, and text colors.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_color_palettes.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_color_palettes.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To **see the entire palette**, deselect all layers. 

To **generate a new one**, press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/w29IHdVZY06gaocLrc13Dw.svg" width="20" />. 

To **change palette colors manually**, click on the color swatches to open the color picker.

Using the document color palette, Lunacy applies color to shapes automatically depending on their size and predicted purpose. Larger shapes have background colors while smaller elements are assigned primary or accent colors.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_auto_shape.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_auto_shape.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Fill types

There are three major types of fills:

1. **Solid fills** (default)
2. **Gradient fills**:
    - Linear
    - Radial
    - Angular
3. **Image fills**

You can set these fills for a layer and adjust them in the **Fill** section of the right panel.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="fill_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/z1-bS8V5Q0yciSJ1pW3kxA.svg" width="844" /> 

**Color picker.** The color swatch matches the color of the selected layer. Click it to open the color picker.

**HEX color code.** Displays the HEX code of a fill. Alternatively, this field shows the name of the color variable applied to the layer. 

**Color variables.** Opens the dropdown menu to view the list of document color variables.

**Fill opacity.** The opacity of the fill. You can also adjust the opacity inside the color picker itself.

**Show/hide fill.** Hides the fill.

**Delete fill.** Removes the fill from the layer.

**Add fill.** Adds another fill on top of the current one. You can move fills around by dragging the leftmost part of a fill up or down.

**Fill properties.** This button opens the panel where you can select between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule" target="_blank">Non-Zero</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even%E2%80%93odd_rule" target="_blank">Even-Odd</a> options for filling overlapping paths.

**Blend mode.** Blend mode determines how the fill blends with the layer underneath. Activate it to set the blend mode for a fill (when active, the option will replace the **Hide** and **Delete** buttons) and click it again to hide it. 

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Understanding blend modes is mainly a matter of practice and experimenting, but here’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_modes" target="_blank">rundown of the theory</a>.</p>
</div>


#### Solid fills

To **define a solid fill**, use [any of the ways described in the section above](#fills).

#### Gradients

**Gradients** are combinations of two or more colors blended into each other inside the same fill layer.

To **add a gradient fill**:

1. In the **Fills** section of the right panel, click the color swatch to open up the color picker.
2. At the top of the color picker, click one of these buttons to select the gradient type: 
    * linear (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="linear_gradient" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/ucBlC-G4FkGfihMcQeu-hg.svg" width="20"/>) 
    * radial (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="radial_gradient" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/VI1Nwhu1AkyQwtPO8_4wfg.svg" width="20"/>) 
    * angular (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="angular_gradient" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/pZ1KZ-MEKU6F_f96xtFiVw.svg" width="20"/>) 
3. The gradient bar with two handles will show up in the color picker.
4. Also, you will see a gradient control with two color points over the layer. The appearance of the gradient control depends on the selected gradient type.
5. Use the gradient control and/or the gradient bar to get the desired effect. 

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="gradient_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/nA3UtzRRd0OMaPHkErHd8w.svg" width="844" /> 

Here’s a list of actions applicable to all types of gradients:

- **Change the color of a gradient point** by clicking it (or the corresponding gradient bar handle) and selecting the required color.
- To **add a color to a gradient**, just click over the gradient bar or the gradient control. To adjust the color, move the handles or the color points.
- To **delete a gradient color**, point the cursor over the respective color point or handle, then press `Del`.
- To **save a gradient as a color preset**, select the variable type (Global or Document) and click `+`.
- To **invert a gradient**, use the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="gradient_invert" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/HNAsjFFLjkKabeS0xaIeYw.svg" width="20" /> button next to the gradient bar.

##### Linear gradients

Working with linear gradients is pretty straight-forward.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_linear.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_linear.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

##### Radial gradients

When you select the radial type, the gradient control is the radius of a circle. You can:

- Select the edge color point to change the size of the circle.
- Select the center color point and drag it to reposition the origin point of the gradient.
- Drag the square handles on the edge of the circle to resize or reshape it into an ellipse.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_radial.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_radial.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

##### Angular gradients

When you select an angular gradient, the gradient control takes the form of a circle with color points on its edges. Drag the points around the circle to get the desired gradient effect and add some extra color points if needed.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_angular.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_angular.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Image fills

To **create an image fill**:

1. Click the color swatch.
2. In the top bar of the color picker, click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="image_fill" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/UaEWmyqIP0iiZAIkJTe_pQ.svg" width="20" />.
3. Click **Choose image**.
4. Select an image from on your computer and click **Open**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_image_fill.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_image_fill.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Use the drop-down list below the **Choose image** button to select the fill method:
    - **Fill.** Adjusts the image size to the layer’s width.
    - **Fit.** Adjusts the image size to fit the layer’s height.
    - **Stretch.** Stretches the image to fit the layer’s width and height.
    - **Tile.** Duplicates the image in a tile pattern to fit the layer. The size of tiles is adjustable.

You can quickly replace an image **or** image fill by holding down `Ctrl` / `⌘` and dropping an image from your desktop or the **Photos** library in the left panel onto a layer, like in the demo below.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_ctrl_image_replacement.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_ctrl_image_replacement.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Tints

Tints are a quick and easy way to apply a color to groups and component instances. They are particularly useful when you need to adjust the color of a semi-filled layer or a complex icon.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_tints.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_tints.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The **Tints** section only appears in the right panel when you select a group or a component instance.

Unlike other styling options, you can only apply one tint to a layer.

#### Tint overrides

Overrides to tints added to component instances are useful when you are designing tabs or panels with elements that have different states expressed through different colors.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/component_tint_overrides.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/component_tint_overrides.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to add default tints before you can create tint overrides.</p>
</div>

When you override a tint, the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/w29IHdVZY06gaocLrc13Dw.svg" width="20" /> button appears in the **Tint** section of the right panel. Clicking it removes only the tint override, while all other overrides stay unchanged.

Read <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/#tint-overrides" target="_blank">more about tint overrides</a> in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/" target="_blank">Components</a> page.

## Borders

You can add borders to any layer except for hotspots and slices.

The **Border** section opens up in the right panel when you add a border to an element. Here, you can adjust a border’s color, thickness, and shape. In this same section, you can adjust the appearance of lines, curves, arrows, and other open paths since they work more or less like partial borders.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="border_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/67iEFdMtKEqsGm6tLZkmWQ.svg" width="844" /> 

**Color swatch.** The color swatch matches the color of the border. Click it to open the border color picker.

**HEX color code.** Shows the name of a color variable or the HEX code of a fill. Open the dropdown menu to view the list of document color variables.

**Color variables.** Opens the dropdown menu to view the list of document color variables.

**Border position.** You can choose to place borders on the inside, outside, or center (default) of the layer’s bounding box. The only option available for open paths (lines, arrows, curves, etc.) is center.<br>
<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="border_position" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/jfsfC2XTOke_nYUnftNKjQ.svg" width="844" /> 

**Show/hide border.** Hides the border.

**Borders thickness.** Determines the thickness of a border or an open path.

**Advanced border settings.** More adjustment options for the shape and appearance of a border. Read more about advanced settings for borders below.

**Add border.** Adds another border on top of the current one. You can move borders around by dragging the leftmost part of a border up or down.

**Delete border.** Removes the border from the layer.

### Advanced border settings

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="advanced_border_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/WOPyBI7ChUalh-reMW6l3w.svg" width="844" /> 

Advanced border settings include:

- **Caps.** Define the shape of the caps of open paths: no caps, round, or square. Open paths include those created with the Line, Arrow, or Pen/Pencil tools.

- **Folds.** Adjust the appearance of the corners for arrows and paths with corners drawn with the Pen/Pencil tool.

- **Start and End.** Determine the appearance of the ends of open paths drawn with the Line, Arrow, or Pen/Pencil tools.<br>
<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="start_end" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/dUfYC480VE-0X2q-gX0Y9Q.svg" width="844" /> 

- **Dash and Gap.** Create dashed lines or borders. Define the length of the dashes and the gaps between them in the corresponding input fields. To turn the border into a solid line, set all the values to 0.<br>
<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="dash_gap" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/2wYx6kpGQ0aqmKR0P27Ibg.svg" width="844" /> 

## Effects

Open up the **Effects** section in the right panel to add shadows or blurs to your layers:

1. Click `+` next to **Effects** in the right panel.
2. Select an effect from the dropdown menu.
3. Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="effect_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/EzR_O8DAKkeQ_xZBwCq5rA.svg" width="20" /> to open up the effect settings and adjust them as you need.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="types_of_shadow" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/cws84rQm1EaaJ32RPGrPZQ.svg" width="844" /> 

### Shadows

You can add drop shadows and inner shadows to your layers. Both types have the same settings that include **color**, **X and Y offsets**, **blur**, and **spread**. You can overlay multiple shadows of the same or different types in one layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_shadow.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_shadow.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Blurs

There are two types of blur effects you can add to layers:

**Gaussian** — blurs the selected layer.

**Background** — blurs the layer underneath the selected layer. To see the background blur effect, delete or hide the fill of the selected layer or bring its **fill opacity** below 100%. When using this type of blur, you can also adjust the **saturation** of the blurred layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/styling_blur.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/styling_blur.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Blur is quite a demanding effect in terms of computing resources. Avoid excessive usage of blurs within a document. For this reason, we limited the maximum blur value that you can set using the slider to 50. Manually, you can set values up to 10,000.</p>

### [Projects](#projects)

To start creating team documents, you’ll need at least one project to organize them. Think of projects as folders for your team’s documents.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="project" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/x3oezjCDwECLaS-udoDJTw.svg" width="844" /> 

All the documents within team projects automatically become available to all team members.

To **create a project**:

1. Select the required team in the left panel of the **Home** **tab**. Make sure you end up on the **Projects** tab.
2. At the top right corner of the screen, click **New Project**.
3. Name your project and press `Enter`.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="creating-project" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/txs4F1_xYEKOBjSbCfVczA.svg" width="844" /> 

You can now add documents to the project. Using the three prompts at the top of the project page, you can:

- Create new cloud documents.
- Import existing `.sketch` files.
- Import Figma files.

To **show/hide a project name** in the left panel, use the **Pin** (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="pin_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/KxHRtwNdm0i00mSBZ7PF9g.svg" width="20" />) button at the top right corner.

To **rename a project**, use the context menu in the left panel or click over the project name in the main area. To **change the project avatar**, simply click on it.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="managing-team" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/9cPfKe6AkUixzwnF4zUQCQ.svg" width = "844" /> 


To **delete a document** from a project:

1. Right-click the document to open up the context menu.
2. Select **Delete**.

Deleted documents move to the **Deleted** section of the **Home** **tab**. There, you can restore or permanently delete documents.

To **delete a project**:

1. Delete all documents from the project first.
2. Click the **Delete project** button at the top right corner.
    
    **OR**

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all users can delete documents and projects. Check out the table below for details.</p>
</div>


### [Members](#members)

Use the **Members tab** to:

- Generate invite links for new members.
- Manage team members and their roles.
- Delete team members.
- Copy a link for a pending invite to resend it.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="team-management" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/sQhrXqgQV0q7xaZRBks1OA.svg" width="844" /> 

To create an invite link, click **Invite user** in the upper-right corner of the screen. The link ends up in your clipboard, and a new record appears in the list of team members. Until the invitee opens the link, you’ll see the **Invite pending** caption instead of their username. 

Once a user opens the link, their username and avatar will show up on the **Members** tab. You can visit team member profiles by right-clicking their avatars.

Use the drop-down list in the **Team permissions** column to assign **user roles** to team members:

**Can view**. Assigned by default to all users joining a team via an invite link. Users with this set of permissions can only view the content of team documents.

**Can export**. This is for developer handoff. Users with this set of permissions can view designs, inspect layer properties, and export document layers.

**Can edit**. Users with this role can create and edit team documents, but they lack certain administrative permissions.

**Admin**. Team admins can do all of the above, as well as rename the team, change its avatar, assign roles to other members, and delete members from the team.

### Deleting a team

To **delete a team**, right-click the team name on the left panel of the **Home** **tab**, then select **Delete**. Note that only the team owner can delete the team.

Deleting the team means that:

- All documents associated with the team move to the **Deleted** section of the **Home tab**.
- Team members lose access to the documents.
- The name of the team appears greyed out in the left **Home tab** panel. A right-click over a deleted team opens up the context menu that lets you either permanently delete the team or restore it.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="deleted-team" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/sMKLT81TTkeHyKlxV_UDQg.svg" width="844" />

Learn how to work with text in Lunacy

This section describes how to add and modify text layers in Lunacy, and how to use the built-in placeholder text generation tool.

## Adding text layers

To **add a text layer**, press `T` or select <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Union 2" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/hfMjzS0lpUy6zmVsPVMJdg.svg" width="12" /> on the toolbar to activate the **Text tool**, then:

- **Click anywhere on the canvas** to place the text layer. You can either type your own text or use the generated text options that appear in the dropdown menu as you create the layer. Lunacy applies [horizontal resize mode](#resizing-options) to text added this way.
    
    OR 
- **Click and drag** to place a text layer with your custom size. Placeholder texts will appear inside the layer you’re creating, with their font size set automatically.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_add_text.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_add_text.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Generated text options include names, job titles, emails, countries, headings, paragraphs, and over a dozen more placeholders for you to choose from. 

Read more about [working with generated text content](#text-generation) below.

#### Text-related menus

Lunacy has a wide range of text editing options, all located in their respective menus:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="text_menus" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/HOLOcZijpk2JFp76wTIDyQ.svg" width="844" /> 

- **Text layer properties in the right panel.** The **Text** section appears in the right panel whenever you select a text layer. It’s a more convenient way to access all the text options available on the menu bar, including fonts, their weight and size, line and paragraph spacing, advanced text options such as text case, list styling, and others.
- **Text style menu.** Also located in the right panel. It contains the list of all applicable text styles in the document.
- **Text options** **on the menu bar.** Open the **Text** tab on the menu bar to access all the text options available in the right panel, as well as the **Fonts embedding** and **Emoji style** options. Read more about [embedding fonts](#fonts-embedding) and [working with emojis](#working-with-emojis) below.

## Editing text

To **edit a text layer**:

1. Click the layer on the canvas or select it in the **Layer list**.
2. Press `Enter` or click the **Edit Layer** button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="edit_layer" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/7QXug2EMM0OE7EyRtqiBBw.svg" width="16" />) on the context toolbar to enable **Edit mode**.
3. Type a new text or edit the existing one and modify any text properties in the **Text** section of the right panel.
4. Once you’re done, press `Esc` to exit the edit mode.

Editing a layer with generated texts won’t detach it from the generated content. You’ll still be able to refresh it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_edit_text.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_edit_text.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Text settings

Once you add and select a text layer, the **Text** section appears in the right panel, displaying all the available text settings and formatting options:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="text_settings" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/0tDtN6hqLUOXVjw9ieUjpA.svg" width="844"/> 

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can apply different font settings of the same type (fonts, font size, color, text size) to a text within a layer. In this case, when this layer is selected, the fields in the right panel will display <b>Mix</b>.</p>
</div>

#### Font list

To change fonts, click on the font list menu in the **right panel**, then:

- Type the font family name in the field.
- Expand the dropdown menu with the list of available fonts, then select one from the list.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_change_font.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_change_font.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The font list displays available fonts and their samples, with your three most recently used fonts displayed at the top. If a font name is too long and seems truncated, hover a cursor over it to view the full name.

You can filter fonts using the buttons above the list:
- **All**: Shows the full list of available fonts.
- **System**: Shows the list of fonts installed on your computer.
- **Google**: Shows the list of fonts available in the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_filtering_font_list.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_filtering_font_list.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Lunacy’s integration with Google Fonts solves most problems with missing fonts. Before you apply a Google font for the first time, it appears without a matching sample. Click on a Google font for Lunacy to automatically download and apply it to the selected text layer.

<div class="callout callout--info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You might experience a slight loading delay when applying a Google font for the first time. Also, if your computer is not connected to the internet, the list of Google fonts only includes the fonts that you have already used.</p> </div>
    
#### Font style

Open the font style dropdown menu to change a text’s styling properties (**Bold**, *Italic*, ***Bold Italic***, etc.) If a font only has one style, this menu will be grayed out.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_block_formatting.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_block_formatting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To change the properties of an individual word, you don’t necessarily have to select it. Just set the cursor anywhere inside or at the end of a word and change the properties. If you set the cursor at the very end of the text, the formatting options will be applied to the entire text. You can also use standard text editor shortcuts to speed things up:
- `Ctrl + B` / `⌘ + B` — **Bold**
- `Ctrl + I` / `⌘ + I` — *Italic*
- `Ctrl + U` / `⌘ + U` — Underline

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_individual_word_formatting.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_block_formatting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    
#### Font size

Use this field to **set the font size** or press `Ctrl + Alt + "+"` / `⌥ + ⌘ + "+"` and `Ctrl + Alt + "-"`/`⌥ + ⌘ + "-"` to increase and decrease the font size respectively.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_change_font_size.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_change_font_size.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also change the font size directly on the canvas by dragging the circular handle at the bottom of the text layer bounding box:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_canvaseditor.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_canvaseditor.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#right-panel-properties" target="_blank">Right panel properties</a>
    
#### Line, letter, and paragraph spacing

Use these settings to adjust the spacing between lines, letters, and paragraphs.

The default **line spacing** depends on the selected font, as well as its style and size. It appears grayed out, but you can change the value manually anytime. To **restore the default line spacing value**, delete the current value and press `Enter`.

The default **letter** and **paragraph spacing** is set to `0`.

You can **change spacing values** by:
- Selecting the required font size from the list.
- Entering a value in the input field.
- Hovering over the input field and scrolling with the middle mouse button.
- Using shortcuts:
    - `Ctrl + Alt + >` / `⌥ + ⌘ + >` or `Ctrl + Alt + <` / `⌥ + ⌘ + <` — increase or decrease line spacing.
    - `Ctrl + Shift + >` / `⌘ + Shift + >` or `Ctrl + Shift + <` / `⌘ + Shift + <` — increase or decrease letter spacing.
    - There is no shortcut for paragraph spacing.
    
    <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_line_letter_paragraph_spacing.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_line_letter_paragraph_spacing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            
#### Text color

Use this field to **change the text color**:
- Click on the color circle to open up the standard color picker.
- Choose a color style from the document colors.
- Enter a color code manually.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When you add a text layer on top of a layer, Lunacy automatically sets a text color that contrasts with the background to save you a couple of clicks.</p> </div>

#### [Resizing options](#resizing-options)
These three buttons determine how text boxes change in size depending on the content:

- **Horizontal resize**: The text box expands horizontally to fit the text content on a single line.
- **Vertical resize**: The text box adjusts vertically to fit the text content, while the width of the text box remains unchanged.
- **Fixed size**: In this mode, the size of the text box is fixed and does not adjust to fit the text content.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_resizing_options.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_resizing_options.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

**Some notes:**
- If you drag and shrink a text box around a single-line text, the resize mode will adjust automatically. Double-click on it to reset the box to horizontal resize mode and transform the multiline text into a single line again.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_single_line_resizing.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_single_line_resizing.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    
- If your text box is larger than the text inside it, click on the text box borders to enable auto-resize mode and make the text box fit snugly around the text.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_double_click_to_resize.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_double_click_to_resize.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        
#### Text alignment

Use these buttons to align text inside the text box or use these shortcuts:
- `Ctrl + Alt + {` / `⌥ + ⌘ + {` — align text to the left
- `Ctrl + Alt + }` / `⌥ + ⌘ + }` — align text to the right
- `Ctrl + Alt + T` / `⌥ + ⌘ + T` — center text
- `Ctrl + Alt + J` / `⌥ + ⌘ + J` — justify

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_aligning_text.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_aligning_text.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also align text within text boxes using the **alignment magnets** that appear around the text box when you select it. They combine the functions of text alignment and text position so you can position your text right on the canvas.


<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_alignment_magnets.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_alignment_magnets.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

If you want to hide the magnets, uncheck the **Text Alignment Magnets** option in the **View** section of the menu bar.


#### Text position

Adjust the position of text content within the text box:
- Position text to the top border (default option)
- Position text to the bottom border
- Center the text within the layer

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_position.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_position.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Additional text options

##### Formatting

Click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Group 4" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/EzR_O8DAKkeQ_xZBwCq5rA.svg" width="12" /> in the **Text** section of the right panel to access additional text formatting options. They include:

- **Transform options.** Choose the letter case for your text:
    - **Aa**: Title Case 
    - **AA**: UPPER CASE
    - **aa**: lower case
- **Decorations.** Apply underline or strikethrough effects.
- **List type.** Choose from numbered or bullet point list styles.
- **Features.** Add special features like subscript and superscript to your text.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_additional_options.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_additional_options.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you select several text layers, the <b>Selection fonts and colors</b> section in the right panel will display all the <b>fonts</b> and <b>colors</b> present in the selected layers, so you can adjust these properties for several texts at a time.</p>
</div>

<br>
<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#selection-fonts-and-colors" target="_blank">Selection fonts and colors</a>


##### Text on path

The **Text on path** option enables you to bend text in any way you want:

1. Create a text.
2. Create a path. Make sure that the path is below the text in the Layer list. Also, make sure that the text box and the bounding box of the path overlap.
3. With the text selected, click ![textoptions](/public/textoptions.png) on the right panel. Then select the **Text on Path** checkbox.
4. To move the text along the path, drag the text block horizontally.
5. (Optional) If you want glyphs to adjust their appearance to the bends, select the **Warp glyphs** checkbox in **Text options**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/textonpathman.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/textonpathman.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

##### Text truncate and Max lines

You can truncate overflowing text with an ellipsis (`…`) when it exceeds the bounds of a text box. This keeps your designs clean and readable without manually resizing text layers.

Also, you can use the **Max lines** parameter to define the number of lines before the text truncates. This can be useful when working with auto layouts.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="text_truncate" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/zEt-SfNPsk-4GazBzGVEBA.svg" /> 



## [Text generation](#text-generation)

When you need to add placeholder text to your designs, there’s no need to leave the app to google them or think of anything yourself: Lunacy does the work for you. Generated texts include names, job titles, various types of contact information, headings and paragraphs, as well as over a dozen more options.

To use text generation, activate the **Text tool** (`T`) and click on the canvas, then:

- Choose one of the text generation options that appear in the dropdown menu below the cursor.

    OR

- Start typing the desired placeholder option (“name,” “paragraph,” “email,” etc.) and choose from the narrowed list of options. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_add_text_select.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_add_text_select.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

When you click and drag to create a custom size text layer, Lunacy automatically fills the layer with placeholder texts. **Auto font size** sets the size of the text depending on the width and height of the text box: Lunacy guesses whether you’re creating a heading, paragraph, email field, and so on. You can either leave these texts or go ahead with your own options.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_add_text_drag.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_add_text_drag.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

### Auto refresh

To refresh the generated text, click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Refresh/Normal" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/Wrpud5KNLUe9hzSDiwGnew.svg" width="16" /> or press `Shift + R`. 

Also, anytime you copy a layer with generated text, a new generated placeholder will appear in the duplicate.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_auto_refresh.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_auto_refresh.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This happens due to **Auto Refresh**, which you can turn off by selecting **Detach from Generated Content** in the layer context menu or in the **Layer → Content Generation** section of the menu bar.

Combine text generation with other handy Lunacy features, like the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#avatar-tool" target="_blank">Avatar tool</a> and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/#repeat-grid" target="_blank">Repeat grid</a> so your design process stays distraction-free:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_avatar_text_repeat_grid.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_avatar_text_repeat_grid.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Text styles and effects

In addition to text settings, you can also apply standard layer effects to your text layers, including:

- **Fills**
- **Borders**
- **Drop shadows**
- **Inner shadows**
- **Blurs**

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_adding_effects.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_adding_effects.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can save combinations of layer effects and text settings as **text styles** which you can reuse across your document. Text styles appear alongside other layer styles in the dropdown menu of the **Style** section in the right panel.

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> When you edit a text layer that includes effects, Lunacy hides layer styling effects and will show them again once you finish and exit <b>Edit mode</b>. This makes it easier to edit heavily styled text layers, like the one below.</p>
</div>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_editing_text_with_effects.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_editing_text_with_effects.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Text and shapes

#### Adding text to shapes

You can add a perfectly centered text layer to a shape by selecting the shape, then pressing `T` to activate the text tool. Lunacy will group the shape and the resulting text layer. The text you enter in the layer will be in **Fixed size** mode, restricted by the borders.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_to_shape.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_to_shape.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This is useful for designing buttons, menus, and similar UI elements, especially when coupled with [text generation](#text-generation).

#### Converting text to outlines

You can **convert text into outlines**, so that every letter becomes a vector shape:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + O` / `⌘ + Shift + O`.
- Select **Outline stroke** on the context menu.
- Select **Text → Convert to Outlines** on the menu bar.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_to_outlines.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_to_outlines.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that text-to-outline operations are demanding for system resources. Attempts to convert large portions of text may slow Lunacy down.</p>
</div>

## [Missing fonts](#missing-fonts)

When you open a document, Lunacy checks whether all the required fonts are available on your computer. If some of them are missing but they are available in the Google Fonts library, Lunacy will download and apply them, provided your computer is connected to the internet.

If they aren’t part of Google Fonts, the missing fonts button (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Subtract" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/kNCv3_mGnU2nETcTBVN0dg.svg" width="24" />) appears on the top bar. Lunacy renders the text layers using the default Inter font, and when you select these layers, the name of the missing font appears in red in the font menu.

Click the missing fonts button to open up a dialog box with options to replace the missing fonts with alternatives so you can edit the layers.

## [Fonts embedding](#fonts-embedding)

You can embed fonts into your document before sharing it with other people to ensure that the text layers will look exactly as you designed them, even on computers without the fonts used in the document.

To **embed fonts**:

1. Go to **Text → Fonts Embedding** on the menu bar.
2. Select the required fonts and click **Embed fonts**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/text_fonts_embedding.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/text_fonts_embedding.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> By embedding a font, you confirm that you have a license allowing you to distribute the font.</p>
</div>

## [Using emojis](#working-with-emojis)

You can add emojis to text layers in any convenient way by using the emoji keyboard on your OS or pasting them into the text box. The emoji styles in Lunacy include Apple, Microsoft, and Noto style emojis. 

Switch through them by selecting **Text → Emoji Style** on the menu bar.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="style_of_emojis" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/9xgNwMCTMUKVQ3ABwzuoAA.svg" width="844" />

Tips and tricks to help you work in Lunacy faster and more effectively

Lunacy has a lot of useful features that can significantly speed up your workflow, all described in detail across the chapters of the documentation. 

If you’re not one to read docs from cover to cover, they’ll probably go unnoticed. So, here’s a cheat sheet of tips and tricks along with demo videos to help you take full advantage of Lunacy.

## Ultimate time-savers

These features are aimed to optimize the design process and automate routine tasks, saving you a lot of time and effort while you’re working on your designs.

#### [Text generation](#text-generation)

When you need placeholder texts, there’s no need to leave the app and google them. Press `T`, click on the canvas to add a text layer, and various <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#text-generation-and-text-snippets" target="_blank">text generation</a> options will appear below.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_text_type_and_generate.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_text_type_and_generate.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

What's more, Lunacy automatically adjusts the font size depending on the width and height of the text box you’re creating. It guesses whether the text box is for a heading, subheading, or paragraph block. Play around with the feature a bit to get a hang of it. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_auto_font_size.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_auto_font_size.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Avatar tool

Create <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#avatar-tool" target="_blank">avatars</a> with pictures of **real-life models** or **generate photos** using AI. 

Press `Q` to add an avatar, and press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Refresh/Normal" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/Wrpud5KNLUe9hzSDiwGnew.svg" width="24" /> or **Generate avatar** to refresh it. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_add_avatars.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_add_avatars.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To create custom avatars, change the **Real-life photo** menu in the right panel to **Generated photo.** Adjust features such as gender, age, ethnicity, and emotion in the right panel, click **Generate avatar,** and let AI do its thing.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_generated_avatar_create.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_generated_avatar_create.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video> 

#### [Auto refresh](#auto-refresh)

When you add generated content, like text and avatars, to your designs, duplicating them automatically refreshes the data so you don’t have to change anything manually.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_auto_refresh.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_auto_refresh.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To disable **Auto refresh**, select **Detach from Generated Content** in the layer context menu or in the **Layer → Content Generation** section of the menu bar. 

#### Repeat grid

When you select two or more layers, drag the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="repeat_grid" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/arkPFiXr3U-oF3BIzB96uQ.svg" width="20" /> near the lower-right corner of the bounding box to duplicate the elements in a grid. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_repeat_grid.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_repeat_grid.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

If the selected elements include generated content, newly created elements will appear with refreshed data (provided the [Auto refresh](#auto-refresh) option is enabled).

#### On-canvas font size editor

You can change font size directly on the canvas by dragging the circular handle at the bottom of the text layer bounding box:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/font_size_editor.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/font_size_editor.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Icon, illustration, and photo libraries

Browse the **Icons**, **Photos**, and **Illustrations** tabs in the left panel to use free Icons8 graphics in your designs. Choose from different themes and filter them by keywords. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_libraries.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_libraries.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">

#### Image upscaler

If you're working with pictures that happen to be of low quality, use the smart **Image upscaler** built into Lunacy to enhance the resolution and enlarge image size up to 7680px × 7680px.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_image_upscaler.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_image_upscaler.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is only available with a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#graphics-subscriptions/" target="_blank">paid subscription</a> to our graphics.</p>
</div>

#### Smart Layer list

Toggle the **Smart Layer list** to only display the layers that you currently see on the canvas. Press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="smart_layer_list" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/3uDOUlA760igh6dc4pOLLg.svg" width=16 /> to switch between the full and Smart Layer list depending on your needs.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_smart_layers.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_smart_layers.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This is useful for really large documents with hundreds or even thousands of layers, when you need to focus on just one area of the canvas. 

<!--
#### Color palettes and auto shape colors

Every time you create a new document, Lunacy generates a palette with document color variables including main, accent, background, and text colors. Deselect all layers to see it in the right panel and press <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg" width="16" > to generate a new palette. 

To change palette colors manually, click on the color circles to open the color picker. If you want the default shape color to be the usual gray, delete color variables by pressing <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="delete_button" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/kZ6IazBibE-dMPVUiDhphA.svg" width="12" />.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_color_palettes.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_color_palettes.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Using the document color palette, Lunacy colors [shapes](#shape-shortcuts) automatically depending on their size and predicted purpose (larger shapes have background colors while smaller elements are assigned primary or accent colors).

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_auto_shape_colors.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_auto_shape_colors.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

-->

#### Auto Z-index

Lunacy determines the order of layers (the Z-index) on the canvas depending on their size. For example, if you drag a smaller layer (that’s at the bottom of the layer list) over a larger one, Lunacy places the small layer on top.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_auto_z_index.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_auto_z_index.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### GUI tool

The <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#gui-tool" target="_blank">GUI tool</a> features a set of basic UI elements you can add to your designs as components. Activate each component by pressing the corresponding shortcut:

`B` — button<br>
`D` — text input field<br>
`F` — checkbox<br>
`Y` — radio button<br>
`J` — toggle<br>
`W` — dropdown

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_gui_tool.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_gui_tool.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Editing live webpages directly from Lunacy 

Use **Linked Design** to update your designs in live webpages right from Lunacy without bothering developers. With **Linked Design**, you can copy an embed link to your layers and integrate them right into website code. Then, if you make changes to the layer, click the <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg"  width="16" > button in the **Linked design** section of the right panel and the design on the webpage will update instantly. No need to bother developers about it.

Here's a short explainer on how it works:

## Sharing your designs straight from the canvas

Press `Alt + С + C` / `⌥ + C + C` to instantly upload a layer to Lunacy Cloud and copy the link to it to the clipboard. This way, you can share your designs straight from the canvas. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_uploading_layer_to_cloud.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_uploading_layer_to_cloud.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

All of your uploads appear in the **Cloud uploads** list. Switch to the **Export** tab in the right panel, add an export option, and click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Vector Copy" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/17oPAse7T0eFJikgES01WQ.svg" width="20" /> to open it, copy links to previous uploads, or delete them from Lunacy servers.

## Speeding up your work with layers

Lunacy has several types of <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layers/" target="_blank">layers</a>. These tips show how to work with them quickly and efficiently.

#### Auto layout

Use <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/autolayout/" target="_blank">auto layout</a> to create designs that adapt to the content as you change it. When you combine several elements in an auto layout, you can change the distances between and around them instantly using the right panel. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_autolayout.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_autolayout.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To add an auto layout, select a frame and press `Shift + A` or click `+` in the **Auto layout** section in the right panel. This isn’t only useful for discrete UI elements: you can build entire webpages whose layout adjusts as you adjust auto layout settings or move and resize individual blocks. 

##### On-canvas controls

You can adjust the spacing and padding in an auto layout right on the canvas by dragging the pink handles between and around the elements.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" poster="/public/auto_layout_canvas_editors.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/auto_layout_canvas_editors.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/autolayout/" target="_blank">Auto layout</a>

#### Snapping frames to presets

A <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#frames">frames</a> is a type of layer that works like a container for your designs, useful for when you're designing for a specific screen size or device. 

When adding a frame (press `A` to activate the **Frame tool**), you can choose presets from the right panel. To speed things along, drag the corner of the frame you're creating to one of the blue `+` signs that appear on the canvas to instantly snap a frame to a preset. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_snap_to_preset.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_snap_to_preset.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Copy and paste layer styles

To copy the properties of a layer (fills, borders, and effects), press `Ctrl + Alt + C` / `⌘ + ⌥ + C`. Then, select another layer and press `Ctrl + Alt + V` / `⌘ + ⌥ + V` to paste the layer style to the new layer. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_copy_paste_style.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_copy_paste_style.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

**See also:**

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/">Layer and text styles</a>

#### Scaling layers

Press `K` to enable the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#scale-tool">Scale tool</a>, select a layer, and use it to resize the layer proportionally without editing individual elements inside them. Along with the size, the scale tool also adjusts layer styles, like borders and shadows. You can select multiple layers and scale them simultaneously.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_scaling_on_canvas.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_scaling_on_canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Hyperlinks between layers

You can create hyperlinks between the layers in your document, even if the layers are in different pages. 

1. Select the target layer and press `Ctrl + L` / `⌘ + L` (or select **Copy/Paste as → Copy link** in the context menu).
2. Select the layer that should lead to the target layer. 
3. Press `F2` to rename the layer, paste the target layer link from your clipboard, and press `Enter`. 
4. Hold down `Ctrl` / `⌘` and click the layer you renamed, and you’ll be redirected to the target layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_layer_hyperlinks.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_layer_hyperlinks.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the layer you set as a starting point is locked, just click on it to be redirected.</p>
</div>

#### Zoom to selection

If you need to quickly zoom into a specific element, find it in the Layer list and double-click the icon next to the layer name. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_zoom_to_selection.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_zoom_to_selection.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Alternatively, select it in the Layer list and press `Ctrl + 2` / `⌘ + 2`.

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#zooming-options" target="_blank">Zooming options</a>

#### Moving layers along straight lines

Hold down `Shift` when moving layers to restrict their movement along the X or Y axis.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_move_along_xy_axis.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_move_along_xy_axis.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Resizing layers with arrow keys

Press `Ctrl` / `⌘` + **arrow keys** to resize layers by 1px or  `Ctrl + Shift` / `⌘ + Shift` + **arrow keys** to resize by 10px.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_resizing_layers_with_arrow_keys.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_resizing_layers_with_arrow_keys.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Advanced text features

Apart from the [text generation](#text-generation) feature we went over above, here's a few tips on managing Lunacy's <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/">text layers</a> and formatting options.

#### Individual word formatting

To format individual words in a text, place the cursor in the middle or at the end of a word and change the text formatting in the right panel.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_individual_word_formatting.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_individual_word_formatting.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To format an entire text block, select the text layer and adjust the settings. 

#### Text alignment magnets

You can align text using the alignment magnets that appear around a selected text box. These magnets combine the functions of text alignment and position alignment controls. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_text_magnets.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_text_magnets.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This also works when you select multiple ungrouped text boxes. If you want to hide these magnets, disable the option in **View → Text Alignment Magnets** on the menu bar.

#### Resizing text boxes

To quickly resize a text box so that it fits right around the text, double-click its vertical or horizontal border.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_text_box_resize.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_text_box_resize.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> A double-click over the right or left border enables <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/text/#text-block-resize-options" target="_blank">horizontal resize mode</a> and transforms multiline texts into a single line.</p>
</div>


#### Adding text to shapes

Select a shape and press `T` to create a perfectly centered text layer inside it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_text_to_shape.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_text_to_shape.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

This is useful for designing buttons, menus, and similar UI elements. Don’t forget to use the placeholder text generation options that appear any time you create a text layer. 

#### Auto text color

When you add a text layer on top of a layer, Lunacy automatically sets a text color that contrasts with the background to save you a couple of clicks. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_auto_text_colors.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_auto_text_colors.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Fonts embedding

Embed fonts in an exported document so that when you share it with your colleagues or clients, they won’t have to install any fonts that may be missing on their device. Click **Text → Fonts Embedding** on the menu bar and embed all or certain fonts into the document. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_fonts_embedding.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_fonts_embedding.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Converting text to outlines
To convert a text layer to vector outlines, select the text layer and:

- Press `Ctrl + Shift + O` / `⌘ + Shift + O`.
- Select **Outline stroke** on the context menu.
- Select **Text → Convert to Outlines** on the menu bar.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_text_to_outlines.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_text_to_outlines.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

**Note**: Text-to-outline operations are demanding for system resources. Attempts to convert large portions of text may slow Lunacy down.

## Mastering image editing

You can import and edit images in Lunacy at lightning speed.

#### Cutout tool

To quickly cut out a part of an image, select it and press `Enter` to enable **Edit mode**. There, choose one of the tools that shows up in the context toolbar above the layer:

- With **scissors**, you can make a selection with any shape by selecting the shape on the toolbar or pressing the corresponding shape shortcut.
- With the **freeform lasso**, draw freehand selections on parts of the image.
- Use the **polygonal lasso** to make selections using paths.

The selection becomes a new **image layer** you can adjust as you like. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_cutout_tool.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_cutout_tool.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Instant image replacement

To replace an existing image with another one without changing the original’s size, simply drag and drop a new image over it while holding down `Ctrl` / `⌘`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_instant_image_replacement.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_instant_image_replacement.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Adjusting image size during import

When importing an image into Lunacy using the **Image tool** click and drag to adjust the image size before placing it on the canvas. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_image_size_adjust_during_import.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_image_size_adjust_during_import.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Image adjust

Change the hue, saturation, contrast, and other properties of your images. 

To do this:
1. Select an image layer. 
2. Click `+` next to **Image adjust** in the **right panel**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_image_adjust.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_image_adjust.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Efficient shape editing

Lunacy's shape tools are varied and have a lot of editing options you can use to speed up your design workflow. 

#### [Shape shortcuts](#shape-shortcuts)

Every shape in Lunacy has a corresponding shortcut, so you don’t have to dig into the toolbar to find the shape you need. Here they are:

`R` — rectangle<br>
`R`, `R` — rounded rectangle<br>
`L` — line<br>
`L`, `L` — arrow<br>
`O` — oval<br>
`O`, `O` — triangle<br>
`O`, `O`, `O` — polygon<br>
`O`, `O`, `O`, `O` — star<br>

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_shape_tools.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_shape_tools.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Editing stars and polygons on the canvas

You can **change the number of corners** in a star or a polygon in the right panel, but you can do this right on the canvas. Hover the cursor over the second-highest corner of the shape after you draw it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_count_shapes.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_count_shapes.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To **change the ratio** of a star (the distance from its intersection points to the corners), drag the handles at its intersection points. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_ratio_star.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_ratio_star.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Keeping shapes symmetrical

**Draw or resize a shape from the center** by holding down `Alt` / `⌥` as you're creating the shape.

To **draw symmetrical shapes**, hold down `Shift` / `Shift`. 

Hold down `Alt + Shift` / `⌥ + Shift` to draw symmetrical shapes from the center.

#### Deleting points and handles

When creating shapes with the **Pen tool** (`P`), hold down `Alt` / `⌥` and click on an unnecessary point to delete it. To hide one of the handles of a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/tools/#types-of-points" target="_blank">disconnected point</a>, drag the tip of the handles towards the point.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_hiding_points_handles.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_hiding_points_handles.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Adjusting a shape’s corner radius

To **round the corners** of a rectangle, drag inwards from the circular handles that appear at the corners of the shape. 

A more convenient way to create rounded rectangles is to double-press `R` to activate the **rounded rectangle** shape tool. If you change its corner radius in the right panel and create another rounded rectangle, Lunacy will remember your last corner radius setting.

As for stars and polygons, the corner radius handle appears at the highest corner of the shape after you draw it.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This method only works with shapes created using the <b>Shape tools</b>.</p>
</div>

You can also round individual corners in the right panel.

## More tips, more tricks

#### Eyedropper zoom

Lunacy’s eyedropper tool is equipped with a zoom option that comes in handy when the target area is small and you need pixel precision. To use it, hover the eyedropper over the target and hold down the left mouse button, then point the eyedropper to the required pixel and release the mouse button:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_eyedropper_zoom.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_eyedropper_zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To exit the eyedropper zoom mode, press `Esc` or quickly swipe the cursor anywhere away from the area.

#### Slices for export

Use the **Slice tool** (`E`) for creating slices around your design and then export just the part within the slice.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tips_tricks_exporting_a_slice.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tips_tricks_exporting_a_slice.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Changing values in the right panel

To **change values in the right panel** input fields:

- Type a value manually.
- Click over a field and use the mouse wheel to gradually increase or decrease the value.
- Hover the cursor over a field, wait a moment until the cursor turns into a double-headed arrow, and drag the cursor up or down.
- Enter an arithmetic operation.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need more space or prefer working with keyboard shortcuts, toggle off the display of the toolbar by selecting <b>View → Toolbar</b> in the menu bar.</p>
</div>

## Select tool

The **Select tool** is active by default when no other tool is in use. 

With it, you can select any layer on the canvas (provided it’s not locked), then move and modify the element as you wish:

- **Select** a layer by clicking it. A selection frame with handles will enclose the element and its name will be highlighted in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#layer-list" target="_blank">Layer list</a>. Hold down `Shift` and click multiple elements to select all of them. If you need to select every element on the page, press `Shift + A`.
- **Move** layers by dragging them on the canvas.
- **Resize** and **rotate** layers using the handles at the coners of the selection frame. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_select_tool_basics.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_select_tool_basics.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also select layers through the **Layer List**. It may be more convenient in some cases, like when you’re dealing with fully overlapping or locked layers. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_select_in_layer_list.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_select_in_layer_list.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Using the Select tool with grouped layers

When you click over a group, you select the entire group.

To **select a specific layer inside a group**:

- Click the layer while holding down `Ctrl` / `⌘`.
- Click to select the group, then double-click to select the required layer.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_select_elements_inside_group.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_select_elements_inside_group.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Then, switch the selection to the other layers in the group by clicking them.

## Frame tool

**Frames** work like containers for your layers. They’re more flexible than layers in a lot of ways and are especially convenient when you’re designing for a specific device or screen size. 

Press `A` to activate the **Frame tool** and drag over the canvas to create a frame:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="frame_tool_create" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/EDEaTb4JWUye0bosk0GAJg.svg" width="844" /> 

Instead of dragging, you can set the frame size using the **preset list** that appears in the **right panel** or **snap the frame to a preset** by dragging its corner to one of the blue `+` icons that appear when you’re adding a frame:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_snap_to_preset.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_snap_to_preset.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can drag layers into existing frames or draw a frame over several layers to frame them. </p>
</div>

<a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/#frames" target="_blank">Frames</a>

## Shape tools

Use these tools to **add standard shapes** onto the canvas:

- Rectangle (`R`)
- Rounded rectangle (`R`, `R`)
- Line (`L`)
- Arrow (`L`, `L`)
- Oval (`O`)
- Triangle (`O`, `O`)
- Polygon (`O`, `O`, `O`)
- Star (`O`, `O`, `O`, `O`)

Select the required shape on the toolbar or use the corresponding keyboard shortcut, then:

- Click on the canvas to **place it as a 100 x 100 shape** (works for all shapes except for lines and arrows).
- Click and drag to **adjust the shape’s size**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_the_shape_tool.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_the_shape_tool.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

Some more shape tips:
- To **draw or resize a shape from the center**, hold down `Alt` / `⌥`.
- To **draw symmetrical shapes**, hold down `Shift` / `Shift`.
- Hold down both shortcuts to **draw symmetrical shapes from the center**.
- To **draw a horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal** line, arrow, or path, hold down `Shift`.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_draw_resize_from_center.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_draw_resize_from_center.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Text tool

To **add a text layer**, press `T` and click over the area of the canvas where you want to place it. Type your text or use the handy **text generation** options that automatically appear when you create a new text layer:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_text_type_and_generate.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_text_type_and_generate.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Pen tool

The **pen** is a tool for creating vector paths and shapes. Activate it by pressing the **Pen tool** on the toolbar or press `P`.

If you’ve worked in other graphic editors before, use it like the Pen tool in those apps. If you’re new to design, it might take you some time and practice to master it. In this section, we’ll go over the main capabilities of the tool.

The pen builds shapes by drawing segments between the points, or **vertices**, that you add onto the canvas. The segments between interconnected vertices are called **paths**. 

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_creating_vertice_and_path.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_creating_vertice_and_path.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Types of paths

Paths can be **open** or **closed**:

- An **open path** has a start point and an end point that are not connected. 
- When the start and end point of a path are connected, i.e. the path starts and ends on the same vertex, it’s called a **closed path**, or a **shape**.


<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="open_closed_paths" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/EwUuc_GDdE27etLumx_9Tg.svg" width="844" /> 


Path segments can be either **straight** or **curved**.

To **build a shape out of straight lines** (e.g. a triangle):

1. Press `P` to activate the pen. This activates **Edit mode**, and the **Edit shape** section will appear in the **right panel**.
2. Click over the canvas to place the first point.
3. Keep clicking to outline the shape that you want. To **delete a point**, hold down `Alt` / `⌥` and click it.
4. Close the path by clicking over the starting point or click the **Close path** in the right panel.
5. Press `Esc` to exit **Edit mode**.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_creating_triangle.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_creating_triangle.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To **curve a path**, you’ll need to be in **Edit mode** (or don’t exit it while drawing with the Pen tool). 

To **enable Edit mode**, select a vector shape, then:

- Double-click it
- Press `Enter` 
- Click the Edit layer icon (<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="pencil_tool" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/FahQcMve1EOAIZSZ_ayN_w.svg" width="28" >) on the **context toolbar**

To **add a curve**:

- Double click on a point
- Click and drag anywhere on a path

Two adjacent handles will appear around the point. Drag these handles and change their length to adjust the shape of the curve. You can also move the point around, if necessary:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_pen_create_shape_with_curves.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_pen_create_shape_with_curves.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
 
Don’t worry if the resulting shape isn’t exactly what you wanted. Refine it by modifying curves and straight paths, as well as moving, adding, or deleting points.

To **adjust a shape**:

1. Select it.
2. Enable **Edit mode**.
3. Make the required changes.
4. Press `Esc` or click anywhere on the canvas outside the shape to exit **Edit mode**.

You can also change the **stroke** of the shape, add **fills** (to closed shapes) and **effects** in the **right panel**.

In the demo below, we added some curves to a heart-shaped layer built with straight lines. Note how a double-click turns a straight point into a curved point that is also mirrored (find out about [different types of points](#types-of-points)).

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_adjusting_shape_with_pen.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_adjusting_shape_with_pen.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To draw a horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree diagonal path, hold down <code>Shift</code> when placing the second point of a segment. </p>
</div>


#### [Types of points](#types-of-points)

Points can be either **straight** or **curved**. 

**Curved points** appear with handles when you build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve" target="_blank">Bézier curves</a>, and have three subtypes:

- **Mirrored** points come with identical handles that mirror each other as you drag one of the handles.
- **Disconnected** points have totally independent handles.
- **Asymmetric** points come with handles that share the same angle but can have different lengths.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="types_of_points" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/N2EKqIYHl0Sv6lODiM61Yg.svg" width="844" /> 

You can `double-click` to **switch between straight and mirrored** points. To **switch to disconnected or asymmetric** points, use the controls that appear at the top of the right panel when you’re using the pen or have **Edit mode** enabled:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_changing_point_types.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_changing_point_types.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also **hide one of the handles of a disconnected point** by dragging the tip of the handle towards the point:

## Pencil tool

The **pencil** is a tool for drawing freehand paths. It’s great when you need to quickly sketch something and don't need perfectly refined shapes. That said, using a stylus with a graphic tablet will give you more precision.

The pencil stroke is black and 1px wide by default. You can adjust these properties for pencil-drawn layers in the **right panel**.

To draw with the **Pencil tool**:

1. Press `P` twice or select it on the toolbar.
2. Hold down the **left mouse button** and draw the required path. 
3. Release the button when you are done.

Unlike the other tools, the **Pencil tool** doesn't revert back to the **Select tool**. It remains active, so you can create as many layers as you want, with each pencil stroke adding a new layer to the **Layer list**. You can always group them later.

Once you’re done working with the pencil, press `Esc` or switch to another tool.

Here are two examples of a word written in one stroke and letter-by-letter (then grouped for convenience) using the pencil. Notice how they appear in the **Layer list**:

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_pencil_single_multiple.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_pencil_single_multiple.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

#### Editing paths drawn with the Pencil tool

Lunacy automatically smooths the paths that you create. You can also **edit pencil-drawn paths** like any other vector path:

1. Enable **Edit mode**.
2. Adjust the paths.
3. Press `Esc` or click anywhere on the canvas outside the shape once you’re done.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_editing_pencil_paths.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_editing_pencil_paths.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

You can also add **borders**, **shadows**, and **blurs** to paths drawn with the pencil. 

As for **fills**, keep in mind that the pencil always draws open paths, even if they appear closed. You can try to apply fills, but in many cases the result is going to look a little weird. If you need to close a path, enable the layer **Edit mode** and click the **Close path** button in the right panel.

## Image tool

Use the **Image tool** to quickly add images from your computer onto the canvas. 

Lunacy supports all popular image formats: `PNG`, `JPG`, `JPEG`, `WEBP`, `BMP`, `ICO`, `GIF`, `SVG`. The `TIFF` format is not supported.

To **add an image** to your design:

1. Press `M` or select the **Image tool** on the toolbar.
2. In the **Open** dialog box, choose one or multiple image files.
3. Click over the area where you want to place the image to add the image in its original size. You can also click and drag to set the required image size.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_image_tool_add.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_image_tool_add.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To activate the **Scale tool**, press `K` or select it on the toolbar. Then, select the element you want to resize and use the bounding box handles to resize it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_scaling_on_canvas.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_scaling_on_canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

The **Scale tool** preserves the aspect ratio and also scales any borders and/or effects applied to the layer. 

With the **Scale tool** enabled, you can set precise values to change the layer size in the right panel, and the tool will scale the layer and its properties accordingly.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_scaling_right_panel.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_scaling_right_panel.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Slice tool

With the **Slice tool**, you can select a specific area on your design and export it.

## Eyedropper tool

The **Eyedropper tool** samples the colors of the elements in your document.

To **use the eyedropper tool**:

1. Select a layer you want to recolor. If you don’t select any layer, the eyedropper will apply the new color to the workspace.
2. Select the **Eyedropper tool** on the toolbar or on the color picker panel, or press `I`. The cursor will turn into the eyedropper, and the **Colors** panel will appear on the left, featuring four pallets:
    - **Recent colors**
    - **Material colors**
    - **Document colors**
    - **Flat colors**
3. Hover the eyedropper over the color that you want to sample, either on the canvas or Lunacy’s interface, and click to apply it.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_using_the_eyedropper.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_using_the_eyedropper.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

That is typically how all eyedroppers work in similar apps. Lunacy’s eyedropper also features a **zoom option** that comes in handy when you need pixel precision for small target areas. 

To enable it, hover the eyedropper over the target and hold down the left mouse button. Then point the eyedropper to the required pixel and release the mouse button. To exit the zoom mode, press `Esc` or quickly swipe the cursor anywhere away from the current area.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/tools_eyedropper_zoom.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/tools_eyedropper_zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


#### How the eyedropper applies colors to layers

Depending on the styling properties of a layer, the eyedropper applies colors in the following order:

1. Fill
2. Border
3. Shadow
4. Inner shadow

So, if a layer has a **fill** and a **border**, the eyedropper will update the **fill**. 

If a layer has no fill, but has a **border** and a **shadow**, the eyedropper changes the **border** color, and so on. 

If a layer has **several fills** (or borders/shadows/inner shadows), the eyedropper applies the color the **property at the top of the list** in the right panel. 

Similar rules apply to text layers, where **text color** has top priority.

## Rotate copies tool

This tool enables you to create multiple rotated copies of any shape around a central point in no time. The tool is great for designing patterns, circular layouts, and symmetrical artwork. 

To enable the tool, select a layer and click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="Copy Rotation" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/vYhxX1OdAUq6KS_Qf0etlQ.svg" /> on the context toolbar. Or use the `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + B` shortcut.

Use `+` and `-` to control the number of copies.

When done, click **Apply editing** in the right panel or click anywhere beyond the shape.

# Color variables
Source: https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/raw/variables.md

How to create and manage color variables


Color variables are reusable **solid** color presets that help you maintain color consistency across your designs. Once you create a color variable, you can apply it to multiple layers. If you update the variable, all layers using that color will update automatically, making it easier to manage themes and ensure uniformity.

Color variables can also be organized into groups, similar to <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/" target="_blank">components</a> and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/" target="_blank">styles</a>, making it simple to switch or edit colors across your design project.

By default, the **Variables** tab is populated with the variables from the document [palette](#color-palettes-and-auto-shape-colors). However, you're free to delete them, and create your own color variables.


## Creating a color variable

1. Select a layer and open the **Color Picker**.
2. Choose your desired color, then click **Create Color Variable**.
3. Enter a name for the variable, or keep the auto-assigned one (you can rename it anytime).

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/colorvariables_ph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/colorvariables.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

## Applying a color variable to a Layer

1. Select the layer you want to style.
2. Choose the color variable from the color dropdown in the right panel (see the polygon in the video above).


## Organizing color variables

For convenience, you can organize color variables into groups.

To create groups:

* Use slashes in the variable names. For example, `Group name / Variable name` or `Group name / Subgroup name / Variable name`, etc.

  OR

* Holding down `Shift`, select the variables in the left panel, then open the context menu and click **Group**.


## Editing and managing variables

- To edit a variable, click ![settings icon](/public/settingsicon.png) next to it in the left panel.
- To delete or rename a variable or group, right-click the variable in the left panel and choose the desired option from the context menu.

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="managing_color variables" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/t1HQ0MFTT0GYedRnK3ODZw.svg" /> 


<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a color variable has an auto-assigned name, it will update automatically when you edit the color. If you’ve set a custom name, the name will stay the same. </p>
</div>


## Color palettes and auto shape colors

All newly created documents come with default color variables for main, accent, background, and text colors. They appear on the **Variables** tab in a group named `Palette`. You can click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="reset_overrides" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/M9n6bSgrBEaWHOHZwLkY3A/PmMyhR72A0GyShZvh91lgA.svg" width="16" > to generate a new palette. 


Using the document color palette, Lunacy applies color to shapes automatically depending on their size and predicted purpose. Larger shapes have background colors while smaller elements are assigned primary or accent colors.

<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="100%" poster="/public/palettes10_6ph.png" height="auto"><source src="/public/palettes10_6.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

To change palette colors manually, click on the color circles to open the color picker. 

If you want the default shape color to be the usual gray, delete the **Palette** group from the **Variables** tab (watch the video above).
