## What is Lunacy

Lunacy is a next-gen vector graphic software for UI, UX, and web design. It has everything you are used to in other similar apps and goes beyond. Created by designers for designers to focus on the workflow and minimize distractions.

Faster than Figma, smarter than Sketch!

No need to buy a Mac and/or Sketch license. Lunacy can handle both dusty kits from Sketchappsources and the latest versions of .sketch files.

## No bounds

* If it is necessary, you can easily import .sketch files to Figma or XD.
