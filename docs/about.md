Lunacy is a next-gen vector graphic software for UI, UX, and web design. It has everything you are used to in other similar apps and goes beyond. Created by designers for designers to focus on the workflow and minimize distractions. No more wasting time surfing the internet for graphics or switching apps to remove backgrounds, or thinking placeholder texts. Lunacy has it all and even more. Faster than Figma, smarter than Sketch!

#### Free

As a design tool, Lunacy is absolutely free for personal and commercial use. But if you need more freedom with cloud documents, teams, or want to use built-in graphics without attribution, you can purchase a subscription.

#### Cross-platform app

Lunacy runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

#### Real-time collaboration

Users working on different platforms can collaborate over the same design in real-time.

#### Low system requirements

Lunacy is not demanding on hardware and runs smoothly even on moderate laptops. 

#### Built-in graphics

Lunacy comes with built-in graphics:

* **[Icons](https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/#icons)**
* **[Photos](https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/#photos-and-masked-photos)**
* **[Illustrations](https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/#illustrations)**

You can use this content for free if you set a link to Icons8 in your final work. Or you can subscribe to one of our paid plans and forget about linking.

What's more, you can use **built-in UI kits** to quickly design interfaces.

#### AI-powered tools onboard

Inside Lunacy, you will find some handy tools that will save you tons of time:

* **Background remover** — get rid of photo backgrounds in one click
* **Image upscaler** — enlarge images and enhance their resolution
* **Avatar generator** — instantly create user avatars when designing contact lists, chats, testimonial carousels and things alike
* **Text generator** — forget about lorem ipsum and add meaningful copy to your designs in one click: names, job titles, cities, phone and credit card numbers, and more

#### Works online and offline

You can work both with cloud and local documents. It's up to you to choose. You can switch between the cloud and local modes whenever you want.

**Cloud documents**:

* Accessible from anywhere
* Up to 10 simultaneous editors
* Observer mode and other collaboration perks

**Local documents**:

* Privacy: what you save to a local file stays local
* When you have to work over a low-bandwidth connection or with no internet at all

#### Minimum learning curve

If you have experience with Sketch or Figma, in Lunacy you’ll feel like home.

#### Full support for Sketch files

Lunacy natively works with the Sketch format. You can do whatever you want with .sketch files:

* Open
* Edit
* Save

No need to buy a Mac and/or Sketch license. Lunacy can handle both dusty kits from Sketchappsources and the latest versions of .sketch files.

#### No bounds

* Thanks to the native support for the Sketch format, you can use Lunacy with all major hand-off and version control tools like Avocode, Zeplin, Abstract, Simpli, etc.
* If it is necessary, you can easily import .sketch files to Figma or XD.
