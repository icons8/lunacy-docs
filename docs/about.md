Lunacy is a next-gen vector graphic design software for UI/UX and web design. 

#### Faster than Figma, smarter than Sketch

Created by designers for designers, Lunacy optimizes your workflow and minimizes distractions. No more wasting time googling suitable icons and photos, switching apps to remove backgrounds, or thinking of placeholder texts. Lunacy takes care of all that, and more.

#### Free

Lunacy is completely free for personal and commercial use.

If you need more freedom with cloud documents, teams, or want to use built-in graphics without link attribution, you can <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/" target="_blank">purchase a subscription</a>.

#### Cross-platform

Lunacy runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

#### Low system requirements

Lunacy isn't demanding on hardware and runs smoothly even on moderate laptops. 

#### Real-time collaboration

Users working on different platforms can collaborate on the same design in real-time.

#### Built-in graphics

Lunacy comes equipped with a variety of built-in graphics, including **icons, photos, and illustrations.**

You can use these graphics for free as long as you include a link to Icons8 in your final work. Or you can subscribe to <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#graphics-subscriptions" target="_blank">one of our paid plans</a> and forget about link attribution.

Lunacy also has **built-in UI kits** to help you design interfaces faster and more efficiently.

#### AI-powered tools 

Lunacy has a wide range of AI-powered tools that will save you valuable time during the design process:

**Background remover** — get rid of photo backgrounds in one click.

**Image upscaler** — enlarge images and enhance their resolution.

**Avatar tool** — instantly create user avatars when designing contact lists, chats, testimonial carousels, and the like.

**Text generator** — forget about lorem ipsum and add meaningful copy to your designs in one click: names, job titles, cities, phone and credit card numbers, and more.

#### Work online and offline

You can work both with cloud and local documents. Switch between the cloud and local modes whenever you want.

**Cloud documents**:

* Accessible from any device
* Up to 10 simultaneous editors
* <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/clouddocs/#observer-mode" target="_blank">Observer mode</a>, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/comments/" target="_blank">comments</a>, and other collaboration perks

**Local documents**:

* Privacy — whatever you save to a local file stays local
* Your designs are always available, even on low-bandwidth connections or with no internet at all

#### Minimal learning curve

If you have experience with Sketch or Figma, you'll feel right at home in Lunacy. The <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/" target="_blank">interface</a> and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/basics/" target="_blank">basic features</a> are pretty similar.

#### Full support for Sketch files and Figma import

The default file format in Lunacy is [.free](https://github.com/icons8/free).

However, Lunacy works natively with .sketch files. You can open, edit, and save them back into the `.sketch` format seamlessly. Lunacy can handle both the dusty kits from Sketchappsources and the latest versions of .sketch files.

If you need to continue working on designs you made in Figma, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#importing-documents" target="_blank">import them</a> is as easy as copying the file link, then pressing `Ctrl + V` in Lunacy.

#### No limitations

Thanks to native support for the Sketch format, you can use Lunacy with all the major handoff and version control tools like Avocode, Zeplin, Abstract, Simpli.

If you need to, you can easily import `.sketch` files to Figma or XD.
