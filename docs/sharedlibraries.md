In Lunacy, any **cloud file** that contains components and/or layer or text styles can become a library. You can reuse those components and/or styles across other **cloud files**. This will help you speed up your workflow and keep your designs consistent.

To connect a library to a file:

1. In the left panel click **Components** or **Styles**, then click ![library_icon](public/openbook.png).
2. In the displayed window, find the file that you're going to use as a library.
3. In the lower-left corner of the file preview, click **Add**. A list of components/styles from the file will appear in the panel.

Now you can start using the library like any other <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/components/" target="_blank">components</a> or <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/layerstyles/" target="_blank">styles</a>.


To disconnect a library from a file:

1. In the left panel, click **Components** or **Styles**, then click ![library_icon](public/openbook.png).
2. In the displayed window, find the library file.
3. In the lower-left corner of the file preview, click **Remove**. The lists of components/styles will disappear.
