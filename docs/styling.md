You can change the styling options for each object in your document. All styling properties for your objects are available in the Inspector. If you decide to remove styling from an object, you need to select the object and hit the ‘-‘ button.

## Shadows

When Shadow is enabled for the object, it will cast the shadow outside of the shape. You can define the shadow’s X and Y position, as well as blur, radius, spread and color.

## Strokes

All objects, with the exception of text layers, can contain strokes. These can all have various thicknesses, colors and blending modes.

The border position of a stroke can be center, inside or outside.

## Formulas

Inspector also supports formulas. You can type anything from 2+2, to complex algebra.

You can drag the values up and down; they will increase or decrease.

## Rounded Corner Hack

You can specify the radius for each corner separately. To do so, type 4 values, each separated  with a space.

This property is especially handy for tabs.


## Margins and Distances

Lunacy shows margins, as well as distances between elements.
