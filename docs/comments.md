    **OR**

    Select a layer you to comment on. Then click ![Comment tool icon](/lunacy-docs/public/comment_icon.png) on the toolbar or use the `C` shortcut.

2. Type your comment.

</div>

## Adding stickers

Unlike text and voice comments, stickers (*thumb up*, *thumb down*, *+1*, *heart*, etc.) show up right on the canvas. There’s no need to open comment bubbles to see them. However, stickers that you use in replies to comments will show up only inside the chat.

1. On the toolbar, click ![Comment tool icon](/lunacy-docs/public/comment_icon.png) or use the `C` shortcut. Then click over the layer or area you want to comment on

    **OR**

    Select a layer you to comment on. Then click ![Comment tool icon](/lunacy-docs/public/comment_icon.png) on the toolbar or use the `C` shortcut.

2. Click ![sticker icon](/lunacy-docs/public/sticker_icon.png) icon next to the comment entry field, and select the required sticker


## Viewing and resolving comments

You can view comments by clicking each comment bubble on the canvas.

Also, you can open the Comments panel and view the full list of comments. To open the Comments panel, Click ![Comments icon on the top panel](/lunacy-docs/public/comments_toppanel_icon.png) on the Lunacy top bar (see the figure below).


![Opening comments panel](/lunacy-docs/public/opening_comments_panel.png)

In the Comments panel, you can choose between viewing *All* or *Unresolved* comments. If you choose the *Unresolved* option on the panel, this will also hide all the resolved comments on the canvas.

To resolve or unresolve a comment click ![Resolve and unresolve comment button](/lunacy-docs/public/resolve_comment_icon.png) in the comment bubble or Comment panel.
