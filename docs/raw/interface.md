- **Minimize the left panel** by clicking on the active content tab.
- **Hide the toolbar, right panel, rulers** and any other UI elements by disabling them in the **View** section on the **menu bar.**
- **Hide all UI elements** (except for the menu bar) by pressing `Ctrl + .` / `⌘ + .`. This activates **Presentation mode**, useful for showcasing your designs with no distractions from the interface.
