# Cloud documents

> Learn how to work with and collaborate on cloud documents



In Lunacy, you can work with **local** and **cloud** documents. You can tell them apart by the icons next to their title:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="local-and-cloud-docs-difference" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/wLqQUPtoZUSZkvVmd9UOBg.svg" width="844" /> 

**Local documents** live on your computer. You can access and edit them even when offline.

**Cloud documents** are stored on Icons8 servers. They’re accessible and editable from any computer that has Lunacy installed and is connected to the internet.

Other advantages of cloud documents include:

- **Collaboration and file sharing.** [Collaborate](#sharing-cloud-documents) with other designers over the same project in real time or demonstrate your work to clients. Also, in [observer mode](#observer-mode), you can watch what other users are doing in real time.
- **Version history.** Track the [different versions](#version-history) of your document. You can save versions manually or use the ones Lunacy saves automatically after every 100 actions. This isn’t available for local documents.
- You can always [save them as local documents](#saving-cloud-as-local) if you need to.

## [Opening a cloud document](#opening-cloud-documents)

To **open a cloud document**:

1. Go to the **Home tab**.
2. Find your document in the **Recent** or **My Cloud** sections and click it.

## [Sharing a cloud document](#sharing-cloud-documents)

You can share cloud documents using both public and private links:

- **Public documents** are accessible to **everyone with the document link**.
- **Private documents** are accessible through private **one-time** links only. You’ll have to generate a personal link for every user you want to invite to the document.

To **share a cloud document**:

1. In the upper-right corner of the canvas, hover the cursor over the **Share** button to open the panel with sharing options.
2. In the dropdown menu on the left, choose whether you want to generate a **private** or **public link**.
3. Next to **Anyone with the link**, select what other users can do with the document:
    - **Can edit.** This option grants full access to the document, except they won’t be able to delete it.
    - **Can export.** Users can view and export selected objects or the entire document, as well as inspect the code of the elements in the document. For instance, you can grant export access to developers.
    - **Can view.** With this access level, users will be able to view the content in the document and copy elements to their own documents.
4. Click **Generate and copy link** and share it.

When invited users access your document, their avatars show up next to the **Share** button. You can individually modify their access level, temporarily ban, or remove them from the list:

Personal settings override the **Anyone with the link** setting.

## [Joining a document shared with you](#joining-shared-documents)

Once you’re invited to the document, open it by copying its link and pressing `Ctrl + V` / `⌘ + V` anywhere in Lunacy. 

Alternatively, you can paste the link into your browser. This will either redirect you to Lunacy or prompt you to install it on your device. 

Documents shared with you appear in the **Recent** section of the **Home tab**, so you’ll be able to access them anytime. 

If you don't need it anymore, you can remove it from the **Recent** section or leave the document entirely by selecting the option on its context menu in the **Home tab**:

You can also remove yourself from the document in the **Share** panel.

## [Saving cloud documents as local .sketch files](#saving-cloud-as-local)

To **save a local version** of a cloud document:

1. In the menu bar, select **File → Save as**.
2. Choose the destination folder and click **Save**.

## [Deleting a cloud document](#deleting-cloud-document)

Deleted documents migrate over to the **Deleted** section of the **Home tab**, where you can either **restore** or **permanently delete** them. Be careful with this option.

<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> On the free plan, deleted documents are stored for <b>30 days</b>. Older documents get archived and cannot be restored. If you need a longer storage period, consider our paid plan options.</p>
</div>

## [Observer mode](#observer-mode)

Use the **observer mode** to follow the activities of other users on the canvas. 

To activate it, simply click the user’s avatar in the top-right corner. You will see a colored frame around the canvas, indicating that you’re now observing the chosen user:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="lunacy-observer-mode" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/0xaWyWocJUOw5UKaDuJr4Q.svg" width="844" >

Click the user’s avatar again to exit observer mode.

<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will only be able to view the user's activities <b>on the canvas</b>. You won't be able to see what they do in the side panels.</p>
</div>

## [Version history](#version-history)

Lunacy automatically saves a version of your cloud document after every 100 actions. 

You can also **save versions manually**:

- In the menu bar, select **File → Save to version history**. 
- Press `Ctrl + Alt + S` / `⌘ + ⌥ + S`.

There several ways to **view a document’s version history**:

- With the document open, select **File → Show version history** in the menu bar.
- With the document open, right-click the **document tab** in the top bar, then select **Show version history** on the context menu.
- On the **Home tab**, right-click the document and select **Show version history** on the context menu.

A panel with the list of document versions will appear on the right side of the interface:

<embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="version-history-open" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/cFOJlZBo0U-vi0rNjn3HaQ.svg" width="844" >

Hover the cursor over the required version and click <embed type="image/svg+xml" alt="open-version-icon" src="https://cdn-eu.icons8.com/docs/Dko8QE6mZ06fz2gAGGUBbA/txwPfDvwFkq5DadtEM1MTA.svg" width="16" /> to open it. The versions will open as local temporary files that you can save to any folder on your computer and then import back to cloud.

You can sort document versions here by the method they were saved: click the **All**, **Auto**, and **Manual** buttons at the top of the panel. 

For additional options, open the **version history context menu** by right-clicking a version. Using the menu, you can rename, open, copy the link to, or delete document versions:
