## General questions

### I’m new to Lunacy. Where do I start?

We have an interactive tutorial with a step-by-step beginner’s guide to our app. Open it in the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#home-tab" target="_blank">Home Tab</a> by clicking **Tutorial** at the bottom of the left sidebar.

You can also:

- Read more sections of this <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/" target="_blank">documentation page</a>.
- Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIp9WVc3HlNF3TGqGvuDsnQ/videos" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a> for more Lunacy tutorials.

### Is Lunacy really free?

Yes. Lunacy is absolutely free: there’s no hidden charges, ads, or locked features. 

Our built-in graphics (icons, photos, and illustrations) are also free for use in personal and commercial projects, as long you include a link to Icons8. You can purchase a <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#graphics-subscriptions" target="_blank">paid subscription</a> to use them without link attribution and get access to higher resolution icons and pictures.

We also have <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/subscriptions/#personal-cloud-plan" target="_blank">professional plans</a> for users and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/teams/" target="_blank">teams</a> that offer more powerful options for working with <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/clouddocs/" target="_blank">cloud documents</a> and collaborating with others.

### Do I need an internet connection to use Lunacy?

Not always. You can work on local `.sketch` documents on your computer without an internet connection.

However, you’ll need to be online to access your cloud documents or work with the content in our built-in <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/libraries/" target="_blank">Libraries</a>.

### Can I downgrade Lunacy to a previous version?

Yes. To do this:

1. Uninstall Lunacy.
2. Download the required version and install it. The full list of versions with links to installers is <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/release-notes/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### How can I be sure that I won’t lose my work if Lunacy crashes?

Lunacy has a mechanism that auto-saves all of your actions, both for local and cloud documents. If Lunacy suddenly crashes, it will re-open the document right where you stopped. 

Cloud documents also have <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/clouddocs/#version-history" target="_blank">version histories</a>: a version of the document is saved regularly so you won’t have to worry about any unsaved progress.

### Why does my antivirus flag Lunacy as suspicious?

There are no viruses or spyware in Lunacy, but in some rare cases, false positives might occur.

If you installed Lunacy from the Microsoft Store, keep in mind that apps can’t appear in the Store until they’re thoroughly checked for malicious code.

If you downloaded Lunacy from our website and want to make sure everything’s OK, you can upload and scan the installer at <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload" target="_blank">VirusTotal</a>. It is a free, reliable online antivirus service.

After that, make an exception for the Lunacy installer and/or the app in your antivirus so that it runs smoothly.

### How do I report a bug?

If it is, contact us via our feedback form: 

1. Select **Help** > **Report a Problem** in the menu bar. 
2. Describe the problem in detail so we can reproduce it and determine the cause.

<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a problem appears only in one specific document, please attach it to the report. Your content is safe: we will delete the file from our system after investigation.</p>
</div>


### Are you planning to go open source?

**Short answer:** Not at the moment.

**Long answer:** We realize this would speed up the development process. However, it would also slow us down in some ways, too. Sometimes, a small team can advance faster than a large community. We may reconsider in the future.


## Questions about features

Questions about existing or upcoming Lunacy features.

### Where can I get plugins?

We removed support for external plugins in <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/release-notes/#version-8" target="_blank">version 8.0</a>. That was a trade-off we had to make to release Mac and Linux versions. 

We’re going to restore the feature in an upcoming release.

### Can I enhance Lunacy’s performance by adjusting video card settings?

If your computer has a discrete graphics card, you can adjust your graphics settings so that Lunacy always uses the discrete card.

These steps will work for the majority of Windows 10/11 computers:

1. Go to **Start** > **Settings** > **Display** > **Graphics settings**.
2. Click **Browse** and find the Lunacy.exe file (the default path is `C:\Program Files\Lunacy\Lunacy.exe`).
3. Click **Options** and set the **Graphics preference** to **High performance**.

If you are running an older Windows version, you can try to do the same using your video card control panel. Here are the required settings for an NVidia card:

<div class="callout callout--info">
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> These settings won't work in energy saving mode and with some specific system configurations.</p>
</div>

### Can I change the radius of a specific corner in a shape?
One of our most popular questions😉 Check out the demos <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/editing/#vector-editing" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/editing/#adjusting-the-corner-radius-setting-for-rectangles" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://community.icons8.com/uploads/default/original/1X/718c05c97ebb1fdbd09cd4e9579178e65f2e8afc.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Where is the suggestions panel?
We decided to revamp the suggestions panel. We’ll add the new version to an upcoming release.

## Questions about possible issues

If you run into an issue with Lunacy, chances are you’ll be able to fix it by yourself. Below is a list of problems that may arise and possible workarounds for them.

### Lunacy won't start. What do I do?

There may be several reasons for this. Make sure that:

- Your operating system is up-to-date. 
- The operating system you are using is compatible with Lunacy. The app is intended to run on Windows 10 and 11, Mac OS, and Linux. You can try to run it on Windows 7 and 8, but we don’t guarantee Lunacy operating smoothly on these versions.
- You are not using an <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/stop-receiving-insider-builds-for-windows-10-be2c37cf-ae6e-c654-a6df-b3ebbcdc3404" target="_blank">insider build</a>.
- The latest stable version of your video card driver is installed.
- Your user account has enough rights to run applications. Try to run Lunacy as an administrator.
- Lunacy isn’t blocked by your antivirus. Disable virus protection and try to launch Lunacy.

### Lunacy is slow. How do I speed it up?

These are the most common reasons for Lunacy running slow:

- **Too many large images in a document.**
    This often happens when you import a lot of high-resolution images and then shrink them to the required dimensions.
    
    *Workaround*: Replace current images with optimized copies.
    
- **Too many shadow and blur effects.**

    *Workaround*: Avoid excessive usage of shadows and blurs.
    
- **Too much large-scale, heavy content on one page.**

    *Workaround*: Split up your project into several <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#document-pages" target="_blank">document pages</a>. This isn’t only useful for optimization, but for organizing distinct parts of your design as well.
    
- **Large amount of text converted to outlines.**

    *Workaround*: Avoid converting large blocks of text (sentences or paragraphs) to outlines.

### Why is the content in Lunacy libraries not loading?

First, check that your internet connection is OK. If it is, contact us via our feedback form and we’ll quickly fix the issue (**Help** > **Report a Problem**).

### A document I was working on is broken and/or won't open. How do I fix it?

To fix this:

1. Make sure you have the <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/release-notes/" target="_blank">latest version of the app</a> installed.
2. Select **Help** > **Open App Data Folder** in the menu bar. This will open up a folder with Lunacy files.
3. Open the **Documents** folder. It contains subfolders with all documents you previously worked on. For convenience, you can sort them by the **Date modified** column.
4. Try to remember the date when you last modified the document, then drag and drop the subfolders with this modification date onto the canvas. Lunacy will try to restore the document.


If it’s a **local** document, its temp file `.lunTempFileSave` may not have been saved as a proper document. To restore it:
1. Follow the steps above to find it in the **Documents** folder. 
2. Change its extension to `.sketch` and <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#opening-documents" target="_blank">open it</a> in Lunacy.

If it’s a **cloud** document, you can also open up its version history and restore one of the saved versions:

1. On the **Home Tab**, right-click on the document’s preview to open up the context menu.
2. Click **Show Version History**.
3. Check the previous versions by clicking _ in the version tabs.
4. Choose the necessary version and click **FIle** > **Save** in the menu bar to save it as a local `.sketch` file on your device.
5. Import <a href="https://lunacy.docs.icons8.com/interface/#importing-local-sketch-files-to-cloud" target="_blank">Import it</a>it back into Lunacy Cloud.

If the problem persists, contact our support team via **Help** > **Report a Problem** in the menu bar and attach an archive with the Documents folder to the report. If Lunacy crashed when you tried opening the document, attach an archive of the **Logs** folder as well.

### A local temp file that was never saved as a `.sketch` document is lost. Where is it?

1. Select **Help** > **Open App Data Folder** in the menu bar.
2. Open the **Documents** folder and sort the folders there by the **Date modified** column.
3. Drag and drop the top folders in the list into Lunacy. One of these is your unsaved temp file.

### Why is there a ‘No connection’ message in the left panel instead of icons?

An issue in **version 8.7.2**. We have fixed this issue in our latest beta build. To install it, use the following links:

* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/LunacySetup_x86.exe">Windows 32bit</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/LunacySetup.exe">Windows 64bit</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.pkg">MacOS .pkg</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.dmg">MacOS .dmg</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.deb">Linux deb64beta</a>
* <a href="https://lcdn.icons8.com/setup/beta/Lunacy.ARM.deb">Linux debARMbeta</a>

Later on, if you decide not to update to further beta versions, selec **Help** > **About** and clear the **Check for Beta Updates** checkbox.

### Why are layers and images on the canvas stretching and flickering when I scroll and zoom?

This is a known issue that typically occurs on Windows 10 computers with Intel CPUs and specific video card models (for example, the GeForce RTX 20 Series).

To fix this:

1. Install the latest stable version of your **video card drivers** from the manufacturer’s website.
2. Install the latest update of the **Intel chipset driver** from the manufacturer’s website.
3. Make sure that Windows is up-to-date.

If that doesn’t help:

1. Open the **Task Manager** and select the Services tab.
2. Stop the `Nahimic` service (an audio service).
3. Restart Lunacy.

If this works, report the problem to the manufacturers of your video card and motherboard. If not, contact our support team (**Help** > **Report a Problem**).
