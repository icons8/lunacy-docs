Lunacy is completely free, both for personal and commercial use. We also have paid subscription plans you can choose from to get additional features and expand your design toolset.

We offer **3 types** of subscriptions: 
* Graphics subscriptions.
* A personal cloud plan.
* Team plans.


## Graphics Subscriptions

Our graphics are completely free, but if you use them in your designs, you’ll need to include an attribution link. Also, SVG icons and high-resolution PNGs aren’t available. 

To get full access to our graphics, you can:

- Choose an **individual subscription** to bundles of icons, photos, or illustrations. 
- Subscribe to the **full set** of our graphics. This option includes everything: icons, photos, and illustrations.

With these subscriptions, you can use SVG and high-resolution PNG graphics without link attribution.

Also, any graphics subscription unlocks our AI-powered <a href="https://icons8.com/upscaler" target="_blank">Image Upscaler</a>. Use it to enhance the resolution of your images and enlarge them up to 7680 × 7680px.

Unlock the full set graphics subscription in Lunacy for **$9.99/month**:

1. Click your account name in Lunacy to go to your profile page.
2. Press **Unlock All Assets** at the top right of the page.

## Personal cloud plan
